========== Question ==========  

### When are verbs appropriate in API URLs?  

========== Answer ==========  

Use verbs in **non-resource URLs** when the endpoint doesnâ€™t return a resource but performs an action, delivering the result. These are not CRUD operations. Example:

```
/translate?text=Hallo
```


> For CRUD operations, use HTTP methods on resource or collection URLs. Verbs in this context generally refer to **Controllers**, and typically only a few are needed.
