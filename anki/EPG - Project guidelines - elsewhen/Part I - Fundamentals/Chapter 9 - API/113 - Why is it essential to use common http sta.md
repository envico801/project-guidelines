========== Question ==========  

### Why is it essential to use common HTTP status codes in API responses?  

========== Answer ==========  

Using **common HTTP status codes** is important because most developers don't memorize all HTTP status codes. Relying on a familiar subset prevents developers from needing to look up each code's meaning, making workflows more efficient. This practice also aligns with the limited subset used by most API providers for consistency.
