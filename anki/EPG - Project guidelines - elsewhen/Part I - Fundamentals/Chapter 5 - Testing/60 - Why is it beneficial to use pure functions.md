========== Question ==========  

### Why is it beneficial to use pure functions for testable code?  

========== Answer ==========  

Pure functions make your code more reliable by allowing you to:

1. Test business logic independently as isolated units.

2. Minimize the impact of randomness and external conditions, which could reduce test reliability.
