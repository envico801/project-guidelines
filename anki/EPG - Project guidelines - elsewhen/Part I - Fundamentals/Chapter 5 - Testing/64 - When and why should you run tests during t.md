========== Question ==========  

### When and why should you run tests during the development workflow?  

========== Answer ==========  

**Run tests**:

1. Locally before creating pull requests to the `develop` branch

2. After performing a `rebase`

3. Before pushing code to a remote repository

**Benefits**:

-   Ensures code changes are stable

-   Reduces potential integration issues

-   Prevents build failures on production-ready branches

-   Catches errors early in the development process

-   Maintains the quality of the shared codebase

This approach helps catch and resolve potential problems before they impact other team members or CI/CD pipelines.
