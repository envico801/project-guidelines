========== Question ==========  

### How Should Build Output Be Managed in Version Control?  

========== Answer ==========  

<hr>

Build output should follow these conventions:

```
project/
├── build/          # Contains generated files
│   ├── dist/       # Distribution-ready files
│   ├── temp/       # Temporary build artifacts
│   └── reports/    # Build reports and stats
├── src/            # Source code
└── .gitignore      # Git configuration
```

<hr>

Example `.gitignore` entry:

```gitignore
# Ignore all build output
/build
# Exceptions (if any)
!/build/.gitkeep
```

<hr>

Reasons for not committing build output:

1. **Reproducibility**: Build files can be regenerated by any team member using the source code and build scripts

2. **Version Control Efficiency**:

    - Prevents repository bloat

    - Avoids unnecessary merge conflicts

    - Keeps commit history focused on actual code changes

3. **Build Environment Consistency**:

    - Ensures everyone uses the same build process

    - Prevents issues from environment-specific builds

4. **CI/CD Best Practices**:

    - Builds should be performed in CI/CD pipelines

    - Each deployment should use freshly built files

<hr>

**Exceptions where you might commit build output**:

-   GitHub Pages requiring built static files

-   Documentation sites that need pre-built assets

-   Libraries that provide pre-built distributions for convenience

In these cases, document the exception in the repository **README** and consider using git submodules or dedicated branches for built files.
