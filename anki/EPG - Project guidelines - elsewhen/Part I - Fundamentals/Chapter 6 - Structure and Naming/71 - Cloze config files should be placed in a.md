========== Cloze Question ==========

###  Config files should be placed in a {{c1::./config}} folder, and you should {{c2::not make different config files}} for {{c3::different environments}}.  

========== Answer ==========  

(Cloze) This approach makes sense when breaking down config files for different purposes (database, API, etc.). It's important to remember that creating different config files for different environments doesn't scale cleanly as more deploys of the app are created.
