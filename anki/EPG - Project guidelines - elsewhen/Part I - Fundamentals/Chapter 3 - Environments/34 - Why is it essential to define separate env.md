========== Question ==========  

### Why is it essential to define separate environments in a project?  

========== Answer ==========  

Different environments often require distinct configurations, such as data sources, tokens, APIs, and ports. For example, `development` mode might use a fake API for testing, while `production` may have Google Analytics enabled.
