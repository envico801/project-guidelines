========== Cloze Question ==========

###  Why should deployment-specific configurations be loaded from {{c1::environment variables}} instead of added as constants in the codebase?  

========== Answer ==========  

(Cloze) Loading configurations from environment variables keeps sensitive information, such as tokens and passwords, outside the codebase, which is essential for security.
