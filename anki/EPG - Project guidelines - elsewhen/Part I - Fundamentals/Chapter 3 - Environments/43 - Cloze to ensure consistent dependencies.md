========== Cloze Question ==========

###  To ensure consistent dependencies across a team, use {{c1::package-lock.json}} on {{c2::npm@5}} or higher, or alternatively use {{c3::Yarn}}.  

========== Answer ==========  

(Cloze) To maintain consistent dependencies, use `package-lock.json` with `npm@5` or higher, or alternatively use Yarn. This guarantees that all team members have the exact same dependencies, ensuring uniform code behavior across development environments.
