========== Question ==========  

### Why should accessibility be prioritized from the start of a web project?  

========== Answer ==========  

Web content is **accessible by default**, but complex features can reduce accessibility. Starting with accessibility in mind makes it easier to maintain rather than having to rework features later to comply with accessibility standards.
