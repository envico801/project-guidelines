========== Question ==========  

### What should you check before using an npm dependency?  

========== Answer ==========  

Before using a dependency, check its version release frequency, number of maintainers, and download statistics to see if it is heavily used by the community. You can use commands like `npm view async` or tools like `npm-stat` to get this information. More usage often means more contributors, better maintenance, and faster bug fixes.

-   [npm view async](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view)

-   [npm-stat](https://npm-stat.com/)
