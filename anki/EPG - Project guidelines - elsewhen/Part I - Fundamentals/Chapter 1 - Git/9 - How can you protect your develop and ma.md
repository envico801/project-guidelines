========== Question ==========  

### How can you protect your `develop` and `master` branches?  

========== Answer ==========  

You should enable branch protection for your `develop` and `master` branches. It protects your production-ready branches from receiving unexpected and irreversible changes. Read more about branch protection on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/), [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html), and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html).
