========== Cloze Question ==========

###  When making changes in Git, you should use {{c1::git add <file1> <file2> ...}} to add files, followed by {{c2::git commit}} to commit the changes.  

========== Answer ==========  

(Cloze) `git add <file1> <file2> ... ` - you should add only files that make up a small and coherent change. `git commit` will start an editor which lets you separate the subject from the body. Read more about it in _section 1.3_.

========== Id ==========
