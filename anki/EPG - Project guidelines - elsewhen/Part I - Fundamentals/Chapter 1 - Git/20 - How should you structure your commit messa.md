========== Question ==========  

### How should you structure your commit message?  

========== Answer ==========  

You should separate the subject from the body with a newline between the two. Git is smart enough to distinguish the first line of your commit message as your summary. In fact, if you try git shortlog, instead of git log, you will see a long list of commit messages, consisting of the id of the commit, and the summary only.

========== Id ==========  
20
