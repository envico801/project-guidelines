========== Question ==========  

### How do you sync with the remote repository to get changes you've missed?  

========== Answer ==========  

You can sync with the remote repository using these commands:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

This will give you a chance to deal with conflicts on your machine while rebasing (later) rather than creating a Pull Request that contains conflicts.
