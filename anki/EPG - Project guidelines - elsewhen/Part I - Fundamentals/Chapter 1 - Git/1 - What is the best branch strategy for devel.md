========== Question ==========  

### What is the best branch strategy for developing new features?  

========== Answer ==========  

**You should perform work in a feature branch**. This way, all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the `main` branch, allowing you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code.
