========== Question ==========  

### What preparations are necessary before pushing a feature and making a Pull Request?  

========== Answer ==========  

Update your local `develop` branch and perform an interactive rebase. This rebases the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and applies your local commits at the top of the history without creating a merge commit, ensuring a clean history.
