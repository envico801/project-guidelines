========== Cloze Question ==========

###  Before making a Pull Request, ensure your feature branch {{c1::builds successfully}} and {{c2::passes all tests}}, including {{c3::code style checks}}.  

========== Answer ==========  

(Cloze) You are about to add your code to a stable branch. If your feature-branch tests fail, there is a high chance that your destination branch build will fail too. Additionally, you need to apply code style check before making a Pull Request. It aids readability and reduces the chance of formatting fixes being mingled in with actual changes.
