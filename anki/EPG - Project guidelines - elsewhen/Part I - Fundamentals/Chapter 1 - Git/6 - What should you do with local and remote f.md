========== Question ==========  

### What should you do with local and remote feature branches after merging?  

========== Answer ==========  

You should delete local and remote feature branches after merging. This will prevent cluttering up your list of branches with dead branches. It ensures you only ever merge the branch back into (`master` or `develop`) once. Feature branches should only exist while the work is still in progress.
