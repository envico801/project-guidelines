========== Question ==========  

### Why should you use a specific `.gitignore` file?  

========== Answer ==========  

You should use [this](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/.gitignore) `.gitignore` file because it already has a list of system files that should not be sent with your code into a remote repository. In addition, it excludes setting folders and files for most used editors, as well as most common dependency folders.
