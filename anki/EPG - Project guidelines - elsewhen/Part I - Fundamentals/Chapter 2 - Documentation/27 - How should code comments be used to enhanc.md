### How Should Code Comments Be Used to Enhance Code Quality?  

========== Answer ==========  

Comments and clean code work together to create maintainable software. While code should be as readable as possible, comments serve specific purposes:

1. Explain the intent and reasoning:

    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment states the obvious
    function calculateTotal(items) {
        // Loop through items and add prices
        return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    }
    // GOOD - Comment explains the business logic
    function calculateTotal(items) {
        // Include bulk discount when order contains more than 10 items
        // This matches our Q4 2024 pricing strategy
        return items.reduce(
            (sum, item) => sum + item.getDiscountedPrice(items.length),
            0,
        );
    }
    ```

2. Clarify complex or non-obvious logic:

    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment just restates the code
    function calculateDateDifference(startDate, endDate) {
        // Subtract dates and convert to days
        return Math.floor((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
    // GOOD - Explains domain-specific logic and edge cases
    function calculateDateDifference(startDate, endDate) {
        // For billing purposes, partial days are counted as full days
        // following financial regulation ยง34.2.1
        // e.g., 1.5 days = 2 days, 2.1 days = 3 days
        // This ensures compliance with contract terms requiring
        // minimum one-day billing even for same-day services
        return Math.ceil((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
    ```

3. Document why certain decisions were made:

    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment explains implementation without context
    function sanitizeUserInput(input) {
        // Replace special characters and trim spaces
        return input.replace(/[<>]/g, '').trim();
    }
    // GOOD - Documents security decisions and their rationale
    function sanitizeUserInput(input) {
        /**
         * Custom sanitization implementation because:
         * 1. DOMPurify is too heavyweight for our use case
         *    (adds 45KB to bundle size)
         * 2. We only need to handle basic text inputs
         * 3. Full HTML sanitization happens server-side
         *
         * SECURITY NOTICE: This method is NOT sufficient for
         * sanitizing HTML content or preventing XSS in HTML contexts.
         * Review security policy SP-2024-03 before modifying.
         * Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/security-policies-connectors.html
         */
        return input.replace(/[<>]/g, '').trim();
    }
    ```

<hr>

**Remember**:

-   Clean code reduces the need for obvious comments

-   Comments should explain the "why" rather than the "what"

-   Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

-   Use comments to provide context that can't be expressed in code alone

-   JSDoc comments for function documentation are still valuable even with clean code

```javascript
// GOOD - JSDoc provides clear documentation while code remains clean
/**
 * Processes customer refund requests according to company policy
 * @param {Object} transaction - Transaction details
 * @param {string} transaction.id - Transaction ID
 * @param {number} transaction.amount - Original transaction amount
 * @param {Date} transaction.date - Transaction date
 * @param {string} reason - Refund reason code
 * @returns {Object} Refund details including approved amount
 * @throws {PolicyViolationError} If refund violates company policy
 */
function processRefundRequest(transaction, reason) {
    // Implementation...
}
```
