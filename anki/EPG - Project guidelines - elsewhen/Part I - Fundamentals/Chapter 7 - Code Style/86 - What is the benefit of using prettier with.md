========== Question ==========  

### What is the benefit of using Prettier with a precommit hook?  

========== Answer ==========  

Using Prettier with a precommit hook, along with `lint-staged` and `husky`, streamlines the process of code formatting. This setup saves time, as Prettier runs automatically before each commit, ensuring code consistency across the project. [More on `lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and [on `husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
