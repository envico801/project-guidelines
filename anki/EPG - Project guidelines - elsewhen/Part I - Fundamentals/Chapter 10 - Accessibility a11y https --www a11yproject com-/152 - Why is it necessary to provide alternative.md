========== Question ==========  

### Why is it necessary to provide alternative text for images?  

========== Answer ==========  

Screen readers have no way of translating an image into words that get read to the user, even if the image only consists of text. Therefore, it's necessary for images to have short, descriptive alt text so screen reader users can clearly understand the image's contents and purpose.
