========== Question ==========  

### What is the benefit of using Prettier with a precommit hook?  

========== Answer ==========  

While `prettier` itself can be very powerful, it's not very productive to run it simply as an npm task alone each time to format code. Using Prettier with a precommit hook, along with `lint-staged` and `husky`, can greatly enhance productivity. [Read more about configuring `lint-staged` here](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and [configuring `husky` here](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
