### Part I - Fundamentals

#### Chapter 1 - Git

![branching](../images/branching.png)

Q:: What type of branch is best for feature development?

###### ID1

A:: You should perform work in a feature branch. This way, all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch, allowing you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code.

**References:**
- [Feature branch workflow by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

Q:: Which branch should be used as a starting point for feature branches?

###### ID2

A:: You should branch out from `develop`. This ensures that code in `master` will generally build without issues and can often be used directly for releases (though this may be overkill for smaller projects).

Q:: (Cloze) When working with Git, you should never push into {{c1::develop}} or {{c2::master}} branch. Instead, you should make a {{c3::Pull Request}}.

###### ID3

A:: (Cloze) Avoid pushing directly into `develop` or `master`. Instead, create a `Pull Request` to notify team members, enable peer-review, and open a discussion on the feature.

Q:: What preparations are necessary before pushing a feature and making a Pull Request?

###### ID4

A:: Update your local `develop` branch and perform an interactive rebase. This rebases the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and applies your local commits at the top of the history without creating a merge commit, ensuring a clean history.

**References:**
- [Merging vs Rebasing by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

Q:: When is it best to handle conflicts in Git?

###### ID5

A:: Resolve potential conflicts during rebasing and before submitting a Pull Request.

Q:: What should be done with feature branches after they are merged?

###### ID6

A:: Delete both local and remote feature branches after merging to avoid cluttering up your list of branches with inactive branches, and ensure that each feature branch is only merged once.

Q:: (Cloze) Before making a Pull Request, ensure your feature branch {{c1::builds successfully}} and {{c2::passes all tests}}, including {{c3::code style checks}}.

###### ID7

A:: (Cloze) Ensure your feature branch `builds successfully` and `passes all tests`, including `code style checks`. This reduces the risk of issues in the destination branch and improves code readability.

Q:: Why is a customized `.gitignore` file recommended?

###### ID8

A:: Use [this `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/.gitignore) as it excludes system files, editor settings, and common dependency folders that shouldn't be in a remote repository.

Q:: How can `develop` and `master` branches be protected from accidental changes?

###### ID9

A:: Enable branch protection for `develop` and `master` to prevent unexpected and irreversible changes.

**References:**
- [GitHub - About protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/)
- [Bitbucket - Using branch permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html)
- [GitLab - Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html)

Q:: How should you initialize a new project with Git?

###### ID10

A:: In the project directory, initialize a git repository with these commands:

```sh
cd <project directory>
git init
```

*Note: Skip this step for subsequent features or changes.*

Q:: How do you create a new feature or bug-fix branch in Git?

###### ID11

A:: Use the following command to create a new feature or bug-fix branch:

```sh
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

Q:: (Cloze) When making changes in Git, you should use {{c1::git add <file1> <file2> ...}} to add files, followed by {{c2::git commit}} to commit the changes.

###### ID12

A:: (Cloze) `git add <file1> <file2> ...` - You should add only files that make up a small, coherent change. `git commit` starts an editor where you can separate the subject from the body.

References:
- *[Section 1.3](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines#13-writing-good-commit-messages)* for more information on commit structuring.

Q:: What Git command allows you to review each change before committing?

###### ID13

A:: Use `git add -p` to review each change individually and decide if it should be included in the commit.

Q:: How do you sync your branch with the remote repository to get the latest changes?

###### ID14

A:: To sync with the remote repository:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

This allows you to handle conflicts on your machine before rebasing or creating a Pull Request with conflicts.

Q:: What is the purpose of interactive rebasing in Git?

###### ID15

A:: Interactive rebasing updates your feature branch with the latest changes from `develop`. Use:

```sh
git checkout <branchname>
git rebase -i --autosquash develop
```

The `--autosquash` option combines all commits into a single one. This keeps the `develop` branch cleaner and avoids multiple commits for one feature.

References:
- [Interactive rebasing with autosquash](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits)

Q:: (Cloze) If you encounter conflicts during rebasing, you should {{c1::resolve them}} and then continue the rebase using {{c2::git rebase --continue}}.

###### ID16

A:: (Cloze) To resolve conflicts:

```sh
git add <file1> <file2> ...
git rebase --continue
```

References:
- [GitHub guide to resolving merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)

Q:: Why is the `-f` flag needed when pushing after a rebase?

###### ID17

A:: After a rebase, Git rejects a normal `git push` due to changed history. Use the `-f` or `--force` flag to push:

```sh
git push -f
```

Q:: What is a safer alternative to `git push -f` if others are working on the branch?

###### ID18

A:: Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `-f` when others may also be working on the branch. It prevents overwriting changes someone else may have pushed.

References:
- [Explanation of `--force-with-lease`](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)

Q:: What steps should you take after your Pull Request has been accepted and merged?

###### ID19

A:: Final steps include:

1. Deleting your local feature branch:

```sh
git branch -d <branchname>
```

2. Cleaning up branches no longer on the remote:

```sh
git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv --no-color | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done
```

Q:: How should you format a Git commit message for clarity?

###### ID20

A:: Separate the subject from the body with a newline. Git will interpret the first line as the summary. You can use `git shortlog` to display only commit summaries.

References:
- [Guidelines for writing clear Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)

Q:: (Cloze) When writing a commit message, limit the subject line to {{c1::50 characters}} and wrap the body at {{c2::72 characters}}.

###### ID21

A:: (Cloze) Limit the subject line to `50 characters` and wrap the body at `72 characters`. Keep commits focused and avoid verbosity.

**References:**
- [The 50/72 rule for commit messages](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule-8a906f61f09c)

Q:: What are the formatting rules for a commit message subject line?

###### ID22

A:: Follow these rules for the subject line of a commit message:

1. Capitalize the first word.
2. Avoid ending with a period.
3. Use the [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).

Q:: Why is it important to use imperative mood in commit message subject lines?

###### ID23

A:: The imperative mood frames the commit message as an instruction for what will happen after it’s applied, rather than a record of what was done.

**References:**
- [Why use imperative mood in commit messages](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2079612)

Q:: What should the commit message body focus on explaining?

###### ID24

A:: The body of a commit message should explain **what** and **why** changes are made, rather than focusing on **how** they were implemented.

#### Chapter 2 - Documentation

![documentation](../images/documentation.png)

Q:: What template should be used for a `README.md` file?

###### ID25

A:: Use this [README.md template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md) as a starting point. Add additional sections if needed.

Q:: How should documentation be organized for projects with multiple repositories?

###### ID26

A:: For multi-repository projects, include links to other repositories in each respective `README.md` file.

Q:: (Cloze) How should the {{c1::README.md}} file be maintained as the project progresses?

###### ID27

A:: (Cloze) Keep the `README.md` file updated as the project evolves to ensure that documentation remains relevant and helpful throughout the project's lifecycle.

Q:: What is the primary purpose of adding comments to your code?

###### ID28

A:: Comment your code to clarify the intent behind each major section, enhancing understanding for others and for future reference.

Q:: When should you include links to external discussions in your code comments?

###### ID29

A:: Include links to open discussions (e.g., on GitHub or StackOverflow) within comments when they provide helpful context or detail for the approach you're using.

Q:: (Cloze) Comments should not be used as an {{c1::excuse for bad code}}. Instead, you should {{c2::keep your code clean}}.

###### ID30

A:: (Cloze) Comments should not be used as an **excuse for bad code**. Instead, focus on **keeping code clean** so that comments enhance, rather than compensate for, code quality.

Q:: How should clean code and comments work together?

###### ID31

A:: Clean code should not replace comments entirely. While code should be as readable as possible, comments are still needed to provide context and clarify complex or non-obvious logic.

Q:: How should comments be maintained as code evolves?

###### ID32

A:: Update or remove comments as your code changes to keep them relevant and accurate. Outdated comments can be misleading, so they should evolve alongside the code they describe.

#### Chapter 3 - Environments

![laptop](../images/laptop.png)

Q:: What are the three main environments commonly defined in a project?

###### ID33

A:: The three main environments typically defined are `development`, `test`, and `production`.

Q:: Why is it essential to define separate environments in a project?

###### ID34

A:: Different environments often require distinct configurations, such as data sources, tokens, APIs, and ports. For example, `development` mode might use a fake API for testing, while `production` may have Google Analytics enabled.

**References:**
- [Learn more about environment-specific configs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8332333/node-js-setting-up-environment-specific-configs-to-be-used-with-everyauth)

Q:: (Cloze) Why should deployment-specific configurations be loaded from {{c1::environment variables}} instead of added as {{c2::constants}} in the codebase?

###### ID35

A:: (Cloze) Loading configurations from environment variables keeps sensitive information, such as tokens and passwords, outside the codebase, which is essential for security.

**References:**
- [Sample configuration](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/config.sample.js)

Q:: How should environment variables be handled in a project?

###### ID36

A:: Store environment variables in `.env` files and exclude them from version control using `.gitignore`. Commit a `.env.example` file as a guide for developers, and set environment variables through standard means for production.

**References:**
- [Guide to managing environment variables in Node.js](https://medium.com/@rafaelvidaurre/managing-environment-variables-in-node-js-2cb45a55195f)

Q:: Why is it advised to validate environment variables before the app starts?

###### ID37

A:: Validating environment variables can prevent long troubleshooting sessions by catching errors early. Libraries like `joi` can be helpful for validating these values.

**References:**
- [Sample configuration with validation](./configWithTest.sample.js)

Q:: (Cloze) To specify the node version for a project, set it in the {{c1::engines}} field of {{c2::package.json}}.

###### ID38

A:: (Cloze) Specify the node version in the `engines` field of `package.json`. This clarifies the required node version for the project.

**References:**
- [npm documentation on engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines)

Q:: What is the purpose of using `nvm` and a `.nvmrc` file in a project?

###### ID39

A:: A `.nvmrc` file and `nvm` allow users to switch to the correct node version with `nvm use`, ensuring a consistent environment.

**References:**
- [nvm repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Q:: Why should a `preinstall` script be added to a project?

###### ID40

A:: A `preinstall` script that checks node and npm versions helps avoid dependency issues, which can arise if dependencies are installed with incompatible npm versions.

Q:: What are the benefits of using Docker in a project?

###### ID41

A:: Docker provides a consistent environment across development, testing, and production, minimizing dependency and configuration issues.

**References:**
- [Guide to Dockerizing a Node.js application](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-dockerize-a-node-js-application-4fbab45a0c19)

Q:: Why is it preferable to use local modules instead of globally installed ones?

###### ID42

A:: Local modules ensure that tooling is shared among team members, avoiding the need for each person to install global dependencies on their own systems.

Q:: (Cloze) To ensure consistent dependencies across a team, use {{c1::package-lock.json}} on {{c2::npm@5}} or higher, or alternatively use {{c3::Yarn}}.

###### ID43

A:: (Cloze) To maintain consistent dependencies, use `package-lock.json` with `npm@5` or higher, or alternatively use Yarn. This guarantees that all team members have the exact same dependencies, ensuring uniform code behavior across development environments.

**References:**
- [Guide to consistent dependencies across teams](https://kostasbariotis.com/consistent-dependencies-across-teams/)
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Q:: How can you ensure consistent dependencies when using older versions of npm?

###### ID44

A:: For older versions of npm, use `--save --save-exact` when installing a new dependency and create an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file before publishing. This will lock dependencies to specific versions, similar to `package-lock.json` in newer npm versions.

**References:**
- [npm documentation on package locks](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks)

#### Chapter 4 - Dependencies

![modules](../images/modules.png)

Q:: How can you list currently available npm packages in your project?

###### ID45

A:: You can use the command `npm ls --depth=0` to list currently available packages in your project.

**References:**
- [npm ls command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls)

Q:: What tool helps identify unused or irrelevant packages in a project?

###### ID46

A:: Use the `depcheck` tool to check for packages that have become unused or irrelevant in your project.

**References:**
- [Depcheck npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck)

Q:: Why is it important to remove unused dependencies?

###### ID47

A:: Removing unused dependencies helps reduce the production bundle size, which improves optimization and load times.

Q:: What should you evaluate before adding a new npm dependency?

###### ID48

A:: Before using a dependency, evaluate its release frequency, number of maintainers, and download statistics to determine if it is widely used and actively maintained. This helps ensure community support, ongoing updates, and timely bug fixes.

**References:**
- [npm view command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view)
- [npm-stat usage statistics](https://npm-stat.com/)

Q:: Why is maintainer activity crucial when selecting a dependency?

###### ID49

A:: Active maintainers are essential for quickly merging fixes and patches, ensuring your project can receive timely updates and improvements.

Q:: What should you do before using a lesser-known dependency?

###### ID50

A:: Discuss using any lesser-known dependencies with the team to ensure alignment and evaluate potential risks or alternatives.

Q:: (Cloze) To ensure your app works with the latest version of its dependencies without breaking, use the command {{c1::npm outdated}}.

###### ID51

A:: (Cloze) Use the command `npm outdated` to verify if any dependencies need updating, which can help keep your project current with the latest patches and features.

**References:**
- [npm outdated command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to update dependencies one at a time?

###### ID52

A:: Updating dependencies one by one simplifies troubleshooting, making it easier to identify and resolve issues if something goes wrong.

Q:: What tool can simplify the process of updating npm packages?

###### ID53

A:: The [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) tool can help manage npm package updates more efficiently.

Q:: How can you check for security vulnerabilities in npm packages?

###### ID54

A:: Use tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test?utm_source=risingstack_blog) to scan for known security vulnerabilities in npm packages.

Q:: (Cloze) When updating dependencies, it's important to always check their {{c1::release notes}} when updates show up to be aware of potential {{c2::breaking changes}}.

###### ID55

A:: (Cloze) Always review dependency release notes to be aware of potential breaking changes. This helps you anticipate and handle compatibility issues that may arise from updates.

#### Chapter 5 - Testing

![testing](../images/testing.png)

Q:: Why is a separate `test` mode environment often necessary?

###### ID56

A:: A separate `test` mode environment can help avoid issues such as:

1. Preventing test data from affecting production analytics or dashboards.

2. Avoiding production API rate limits, which might block test calls if exceeded.

Q:: (Cloze) Test files should be placed {{c1::next to the tested modules}} using the naming convention {{c2::\*.test.js}} or {{c3::\*.spec.js}}.

###### ID57

A:: (Cloze) Place test files next to the modules they test, using the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`. This organization makes it easy to locate tests without navigating through complex folder structures.

**References:**
- [Read more on code structure for testability](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

Q:: Where should additional test files that don’t relate to specific files be stored?

###### ID58

A:: Store additional test files in a separate folder, usually named `__test__`, to keep them distinct from specific implementation files and reduce confusion.

Q:: Why is the `__test__` folder name widely adopted?

###### ID59

A:: The `__test__` folder name is considered a standard convention and is automatically recognized by many JavaScript testing frameworks.

Q:: What are the key characteristics of testable code?

###### ID60

A:: Testable code should:

1. Avoid side effects.
2. Extract side effects to isolated functions.
3. Make use of pure functions for predictable results.

Q:: (Cloze) A {{c1::pure function}} is a function that always returns the {{c2::same output}} for the {{c3::same input}}.

###### ID61

A:: (Cloze) A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects. In contrast, an impure function may rely on external factors or cause side effects, making it less predictable.

Q:: What is the benefit of using a static type checker in testing?

###### ID63

A:: A static type checker enhances reliability by catching type-related errors before runtime, contributing to more robust code.

**References:**
- [FreeCodeCamp article on static types](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb)

Q:: When should you run tests relative to making pull requests?

###### ID64

A:: Run tests locally before creating any pull requests to the `develop` branch. This ensures your code changes are stable and reduces potential integration issues.

Q:: Why should you run tests before pushing code to a remote repository?

###### ID65

A:: Running tests after a `rebase` and before pushing code to a remote repository helps prevent build failures on production-ready branches.

Q:: Why is test documentation important?

###### ID66

A:: Documenting tests provides clarity and context, making it easier for other developers, DevOps, QA, and future contributors to understand and run tests effectively.

#### Chapter 6 - Structure and Naming

![folder-tree](../images/folder-tree.png)

Q:: How should project files be organized?

###### ID67

A:: Organize files around product features, pages, or components, rather than by role. Place test files next to the code they test.

**Bad**

```
.
├── controllers
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
├── models
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
```

**Good**

```
.
├── product
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── product.js
|   └── product.test.js
├── user
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── user.js
|   └── user.test.js
```

Q:: (Cloze) In a well-organized project structure, you should create {{c1::small modules}} that {{c2::encapsulate one responsibility}} including its {{c3::test}}.

###### ID68

A:: (Cloze) Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility, including their test. This structure makes it easier to navigate and find files quickly.

Q:: Where should additional test files be stored?

###### ID69

A:: Place additional test files in a separate test folder to avoid confusion.

Q:: Why is a dedicated test folder helpful for additional test files?

###### ID70

A:: A separate test folder saves time for other developers and DevOps experts by keeping test files organized and easy to locate.

Q:: (Cloze) Config files should be placed in a {{c1::./config}} folder, and you should {{c2::not make different config files}} for {{c3::different environments}}.

###### ID71

A:: (Cloze) Configuration files should go in a `./config` folder, without creating separate config files for each environment. Instead, manage configuration based on purpose (e.g., database, API) for a scalable approach.

Q:: How should values for configuration files be supplied?

###### ID72

A:: Use environment variables to provide values for config files, keeping configuration flexible and secure.

**References:**
- [Read more on configuration management](https://medium.com/@fedorHK/no-config-b3f1171eecd5)

Q:: Where should scripts be placed within the project structure?

###### ID73

A:: Place scripts, such as bash and node scripts, in a `./scripts` folder for organization and easy access.

Q:: Why is it useful to have a dedicated folder for scripts?

###### ID74

A:: A dedicated `./scripts` folder is helpful as projects often have multiple scripts, like production builds, development builds, database synchronization, and more.

Q:: (Cloze) Build output should be placed in a {{c1::./build}} folder, and {{c2::build/}} should be added to {{c3::.gitignore}}.

###### ID75

A:: (Cloze) Store build output in a `./build` folder and add `build/` to `.gitignore`. This folder contains generated files, which can be recreated as needed.

Q:: Why should build output not be committed to the remote repository?

###### ID76

A:: Generated files should be reproducible by any team member, so there’s no need to commit them to the remote repository unless specifically required.

#### Chapter 7 - Code style

![code-style](../images/code-style.png)

Q:: What JavaScript syntax is recommended for new projects?

###### ID77

A:: Use stage-2 and higher JavaScript (modern) syntax for new projects. For old projects, stay consistent with existing syntax unless you intend to modernize the project.

Q:: Why is it recommended to use stage-2 and higher JavaScript syntax?

###### ID78

A:: Stage-2 syntax is more likely to eventually become part of the spec with only minor revisions. Transpilers can be used to take advantage of new syntax features.

Q:: (Cloze) Code style checks should be included in your {{c1::build process}}.

###### ID79

A:: (Cloze) Breaking your build is one way of enforcing code style. It prevents you from taking it less seriously. Do it for both client and server-side code. [read more...](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)

Q:: What tool is recommended to enforce code style in JavaScript?

###### ID80

A:: [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) is recommended to enforce code style.

Q:: Why is ESLint preferred for enforcing code style?

###### ID81

A:: ESLint has more rules supported, the ability to configure the rules, and the ability to add custom rules.

Q:: Which JavaScript Style Guide is recommended?

###### ID82

A:: The [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is recommended.

[Read more](https://www.gitbook.com/book/duk/airbnb-javascript-guidelines/details)

Q:: (Cloze) For projects using {{c1::FlowType}}, it's recommended to use {{c2::Flow type style check rules}} for {{c3::ESLint}}.

###### ID83

A:: (Cloze) Flow introduces few syntaxes that also need to follow certain code style and be checked.

[Flow type style check rules for ESLint](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype)

[FlowType](https://flow.org/)

Q:: What is the purpose of using a `.eslintignore` file?

###### ID84

A:: The `.eslintignore` file is used to exclude files or folders from code style checks without polluting your code with `eslint-disable` comments.

Q:: What should be done with `eslint` disable comments before making a Pull Request?

###### ID85

A:: Remove any of your `eslint` disable comments before making a Pull Request.

Q:: How should small tasks be marked in the code?

###### ID86

A:: Use `//TODO:` comments for small tasks. For larger tasks, use `//TODO(#3456)` where the number is an open ticket.

Q:: (Cloze) Comments should be {{c1::kept relevant}} as code changes, and {{c2::commented blocks of code}} should be {{c3::removed}}.

###### ID87

A:: (Cloze) Your code should be as readable as possible, you should get rid of anything distracting. If you refactored a function, don't just comment out the old one, remove it.

Q:: Why should irrelevant or funny comments, logs, or naming be avoided?

###### ID88

A:: While your build process may (should) get rid of them, sometimes your source code may get handed over to another company/client and they may not share the same banter.

Q:: What guidelines are given for naming functions?

###### ID89

A:: For functions, use long, descriptive names. A function name should be a verb or a verb phrase, and it needs to communicate its intention.

Q:: How should functions be organized in a file?

###### ID90

A:: Organize your functions in a file according to the step-down rule. Higher level functions should be on top and lower levels below.

Q:: What is the purpose of using a .editorconfig file in a project?

###### ID91

A:: A [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs on the project. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

Q:: How can you make your editor notify you about code style errors?

###### ID92

A:: Use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) with your existing ESLint configuration. [Read more...](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation)

Q:: Why should you consider using Git hooks?

###### ID93

A:: Git hooks greatly increase a developer's productivity. They allow you to make changes, commit and push to staging or production environments without the fear of breaking builds. [Read more...](http://githooks.com/)

Q:: What is the benefit of using Prettier with a precommit hook?

###### ID94

A:: While `prettier` itself can be very powerful, it's not very productive to run it simply as an npm task alone each time to format code. Using Prettier with a precommit hook, along with `lint-staged` and `husky`, can greatly enhance productivity. [Read more about configuring `lint-staged` here](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and [configuring `husky` here](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

#### Chapter 8 - Logging

![logging](../images/logging.png)

Q:: Why should you avoid client-side console logs in production?

###### ID95

A:: Even though your build process can (and should) get rid of them, it's important to ensure that your code style checker warns you about leftover console logs. This helps prevent unintended logging in production environments.

Q:: What is the recommended approach for production logging?

###### ID96

A:: It's recommended to use logging libraries for production mode, such as [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan). These libraries help produce readable production logging.

Q:: What are the benefits of using logging libraries in production?

###### ID97

A:: Using logging libraries makes troubleshooting less unpleasant by providing features such as colorization, timestamps, logging to a file in addition to the console, or even logging to a file that rotates daily. [Read more...](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/)

#### Chapter 9 - API

![api](../images/api.png)

Q:: What are the three main factors in resource-oriented design for APIs?

###### ID98

A:: The three main factors in resource-oriented design are:

1. Resources (which have data, can be nested, and have methods that operate against them)

2. Collections (groups of resources)

3. URLs (which identify the online location of resources or collections)

Q:: Why is resource-oriented design beneficial for API development?

###### ID99

A:: Resource-oriented design is beneficial because:

1. It's well-known to developers (the main API consumers)

2. It offers readability and ease of use

3. It allows for writing generic libraries and connectors without knowing the specifics of the API

Q:: What case should be used for URLs and resource names in API design?

###### ID100

A:: Use kebab-case for URLs and plural kebab-case for resource names in URLs.

Q:: What case should be used for parameters in the query string or resource fields?

###### ID101

A:: Use camelCase for parameters in the query string or resource fields.

Q:: Why should plural nouns be used for naming URLs pointing to collections?

###### ID102

A:: Plural nouns should be used for naming URLs pointing to collections (e.g., `/users`) because it reads better and keeps URLs consistent. [Read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-plural-nouns-and-concrete-names)

Q:: How should plurals be handled in source code for variables and properties?

###### ID103

A:: In the source code, convert plurals to variables and properties with a List suffix. This is because plural is nice in the URL, but in the source code, it's too subtle and error-prone.

Q:: What is the recommended format for URLs pointing to a specific resource?

###### ID104

A:: Always use a singular concept that starts with a collection and ends with an identifier, for example:

```

/students/245743

/airports/kjfk

```

Avoid URLs like this:

```
GET /blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId/summary
```

Why

> This is not pointing to a resource but to a property instead. You can pass the property as a parameter to trim your response.

Q:: (Cloze) In API design, it's recommended to keep {{c1::verbs}} out of your {{c2::resource URLs}} because using a verb for each resource operation can lead to {{c3::a huge list of URLs}} and {{c4::no consistent pattern}}.

###### ID105

A:: (Cloze) This makes it difficult for developers to learn the API. Verbs are used for something else in API design.

Q:: When is it appropriate to use verbs in API URLs?

###### ID106

A:: Use verbs for non-resources, when your API doesn't return any resources but instead executes an operation and returns the result. These are not CRUD operations. For example:

```

/translate?text=Hallo

```

Why

> Because for CRUD we use HTTP methods on `resource` or `collection` URLs. The verbs we were talking about are actually `Controllers`. You usually don't develop many of these. [read more...](https://github.com/byrondover/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md#controller)

Q:: What case should be used for JSON property names in request bodies or response types?

###### ID107

A:: Follow `camelCase` for `JSON` property names in request bodies or response types to maintain consistency. This is because these guidelines assume JavaScript is used for generating and parsing JSON.

Q:: Why should you avoid using table_name for a resource name and column_name for resource properties in API design?

###### ID108

A:: Because your intention is to expose Resources, not your database schema details. This abstraction helps maintain separation between your API design and database structure.

Q:: How should CRUD functionalities be explained using HTTP methods in API design?

###### ID109

A:: CRUD functionalities should be explained using HTTP methods as follows:

- GET: To retrieve a representation of a resource

- POST: To create new resources and sub-resources

- PUT: To update existing resources

- PATCH: To update existing resources, only updating the fields that were supplied

- DELETE: To delete existing resources

Q:: How should nested resources be represented in API URLs?

###### ID110

A:: For nested resources, use the relation between them in the URL. For example:

> `GET /schools/2/students ` , should get the list of all students from school 2.

> `GET /schools/2/students/31` , should get the details of student 31, which belongs to school 2.

> `DELETE /schools/2/students/31` , should delete student 31, which belongs to school 2.

> `PUT /schools/2/students/31` , should update info of student 31, Use PUT on resource-URL only, not collection.

> `POST /schools` , should create a new school and return the details of the new school created. Use POST on collection-URLs.

Q:: What is the recommended approach for versioning APIs in the URL?

###### ID111

A:: Use a simple ordinal number for a version with a `v` prefix (v1, v2). Move it all the way to the left in the URL so that it has the highest scope. For example:

```

http://api.domain.com/v1/schools/3/students

```

Why

> When your APIs are public for other third parties, upgrading the APIs with some breaking change would also lead to breaking the existing products or services using your APIs. Using versions in your URL can prevent that from happening. [read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-tips-versioning)

Q:: (Cloze) A good error message response in an API should include a {{c1::code}}, a {{c2::message}}, and a {{c3::description}}. For validation errors, it should also include an {{c4::errors}} array with details for each error.

###### ID112

A:: (Cloze) This structure helps developers troubleshoot and resolve issues when using your APIs.

A good error message response might look something like this:

```json
{
  "code": 1234,
  "message": "Something bad happened",
  "description": "More details"
}
```

or for validation errors:

```json
{
  "code": 2314,
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1233,
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Invalid email"
    },
    {
      "code": 1234,
      "field": "password",
      "message": "No password provided"
    }
  ]
}
```

Q:: What are some important HTTP status codes to use in API responses, and what do they indicate?

###### ID113

A:: Some important HTTP status codes include:

> `200 OK` response represents success for `GET`, `PUT` or `POST` requests.

> `201 Created` for when a new instance is created. Creating a new instance, using `POST` method returns `201` status code.

> `204 No Content` response represents success but there is no content to be sent in the response. Use it when `DELETE` operation succeeds.

> `304 Not Modified` response is to minimize information transfer when the recipient already has cached representations.

> `400 Bad Request` for when the request was not processed, as the server could not understand what the client is asking for.

> `401 Unauthorized` for when the request lacks valid credentials and it should re-request with the required credentials.

> `403 Forbidden` means the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

> `404 Not Found` indicates that the requested resource was not found.

> `500 Internal Server Error` indicates that the request is valid, but the server could not fulfill it due to some unexpected condition.

Q:: How can you limit the amount of data returned in an API response?

###### ID114

A:: Use a fields query parameter that takes a comma-separated list of fields to include. For example:

```

GET /students?fields=id,name,age,class

```

Q:: (Cloze) When designing APIs, it's recommended to provide {{c1::total numbers of resources}} in your response and accept {{c2::limit}} and {{c3::offset}} parameters for {{c4::pagination}}.

###### ID115

A:: (Cloze) Additionally, filtering and sorting don't need to be supported from the start for all resources, but should be documented for resources that offer these features.

Q:: Why is it important to use common HTTP status codes in API responses?

###### ID116

A:: Using common HTTP status codes is important because most developers don't have all 70+ HTTP status codes memorized. Using uncommon status codes might force developers to look up their meanings, disrupting their workflow. Most API providers use a small subset of HTTP status codes for clarity and ease of use. [read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-what-about-errors)

Q:: How should security exception messages be handled in API responses?

###### ID117

A:: Keep security exception messages as generic as possible. For instance, instead of saying 'incorrect password', reply with 'invalid username or password'. This prevents unknowingly informing the user that the username was correct and only the password was incorrect.

Q:: Why should basic authentication not be used unless over a secure connection (HTTPS)?

###### ID118

A:: Basic authentication should not be used without HTTPS because the token, user ID, and password are transmitted over the network as clear text (base64 encoded, which is reversible). This makes the basic authentication scheme insecure. [Read more...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)

Q:: How should authentication tokens be transmitted in API requests?

###### ID119

A:: Authentication tokens must be transmitted using the Authorization header on every request. For example: `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx, Extra yyyyy`. They should not be transmitted in the URL.

Q:: (Cloze) To enhance API security, {{c1::Authorization Code}} should be {{c2::short-lived}}, and any {{c3::non-TLS requests}} should be rejected by responding with {{c4::403 Forbidden}}.

###### ID120

A:: (Cloze) These measures help protect against unauthorized access and insecure data exchange.

Q:: Why is Rate Limiting important for API security?

###### ID121

A:: Rate Limiting is important to protect your APIs from bot threats that may call your API thousands of times per hour. It's recommended to implement rate limiting early on in your API development process.

Q:: What should an API do with received data to ensure security?

###### ID122

A:: An API should convert the received data to their canonical form or reject them. If there are any errors from bad or missing data, the API should return a 400 Bad Request status with details about the errors.

Q:: Why is it important to serialize JSON in API responses?

###### ID123

A:: Serializing JSON is crucial because a key concern with JSON encoders is preventing arbitrary JavaScript remote code execution within the browser or on the server (if using node.js). Using a proper JSON serializer to encode user-supplied data properly prevents the execution of user-supplied input on the browser.

Q:: (Cloze) When validating the content-type in API requests, it's recommended to mostly use {{c1::application/*json}}. Accepting other mime types like {{c2::application/x-www-form-urlencoded}} could allow attackers to {{c3::create a form and trigger a simple POST request}}.

###### ID124

A:: (Cloze) The server should never assume the Content-Type. A lack of Content-Type header or an unexpected Content-Type header should result in the server rejecting the content with a 4XX response.

Q:: What security measures can be implemented through HTTP headers?

###### ID125

A:: Setting HTTP headers appropriately can help to lock down and secure your web application. The Helmet project provides a set of security middleware for Express apps that can help set various HTTP headers. [Read more...](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

Q:: How should an API handle data validation?

###### ID126

A:: All the data exchanged with the REST API must be validated by the API. This includes both incoming requests and outgoing responses to ensure data integrity and security.

Q:: What additional resource can be consulted for a comprehensive API security checklist?

###### ID127

A:: The API Security Checklist Project provides a comprehensive list of security best practices for API development. [Read more...](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist)

Q:: What should be included in the API Reference section of the README.md file?

###### ID128

A:: The API Reference section in the README.md file should include a comprehensive description of the API, including authentication methods, URL structure, request types, and details for each endpoint.

[README.md template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md)

Q:: How should API authentication methods be documented?

###### ID129

A:: API authentication methods should be described with a code sample to demonstrate their proper usage.

Q:: What information should be included when explaining the URL structure of an API?

###### ID130

A:: When explaining the URL structure of an API, include the path (without the root URL) and the request type (Method) for each endpoint.

Q:: How should URL parameters be documented in API documentation?

###### ID131

A:: URL parameters should be documented as follows:

- Specify if they are Required or Optional

- Provide the name and type of each parameter

For example:

```

Required: id=[integer]

Optional: photo_id=[alphanumeric]

```

Q:: (Cloze) For POST requests in API documentation, you should provide {{c1::working examples}} and separate the parameters into {{c2::Optional}} and {{c3::Required}} sections.

###### ID132

A:: (Cloze) This helps users understand how to properly structure their POST requests to the API.

Q:: What information should be included in the Success Response section of API documentation?

###### ID133

A:: The Success Response section should include:

- The expected status code

- Any return data

For example:

```

Code: 200

Content: { id : 12 }

```

Q:: How should Error Responses be documented in API documentation?

###### ID134

A:: Error Responses should be documented comprehensively, including:

- All possible ways an endpoint can fail (e.g., unauthorized access, wrong parameters)

- The error code, message, and description for each error case

For example:

```json

{

  "code": 401,

  "message": "Authentication failed",

  "description": "Invalid username or password"

}

```

Q:: Why is it important to document all possible error responses for an API endpoint?

###### ID135

A:: Documenting all possible error responses helps prevent assumptions from being made by API users. Even if it seems repetitive, it provides clear expectations for all potential failure scenarios.

Q:: (Cloze) Two popular open-source tools for API documentation are {{c1::API Blueprint}} and {{c2::Swagger}}.

###### ID136

A:: (Cloze) These tools can help create good, standardized documentation for your API.

- [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

Q:: What are the key components that should be explained for each API endpoint in the documentation?

###### ID137

A:: For each API endpoint, the documentation should explain:

1. The URL structure (path only, no root URL)

2. The request type (Method)

3. URL parameters (if any), specifying if they are required or optional

4. Request body for POST requests, with examples

5. Success response (status code and return data)

6. Possible error responses (status codes, messages, and descriptions)

#### Chapter 10 - Accessibility

[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/)

![accessibility](../images/accessibility.png)

Q:: Why is it important to consider accessibility at the start of a web project?

###### ID138

A:: Web content is [accessible by default](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML), but we often compromise this when building complex features. It's much easier to maintain accessibility by considering it from the start rather than re-implementing features later.

Q:: What tools are recommended for regular accessibility audits?

###### ID139

A:: Two recommended tools for regular accessibility audits are:

1. [Lighthouse accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) in Google Chrome DevTools

2. The [axe DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US)

Q:: (Cloze) The scoring in accessibility audit tools like Lighthouse and axe is based on {{c1::axe user impact assessments}}.

###### ID140

A:: (Cloze) These assessments help determine the severity and impact of accessibility issues.

[axe user impact assessments](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md#wcag-21-level-a--aa-rules)

Q:: What important accessibility checks must be done manually?

###### ID141

A:: Some important accessibility checks that must be done manually include logical tab order. These are often listed as manual/guided tests alongside automated results in tools like Lighthouse and axe.

[Read more...](https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/#additional-items-to-manually-check)

Q:: What are some recommended accessibility linters for different frameworks?

###### ID142

A:: Recommended accessibility linters for different frameworks include:

- React: [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

- Angular: [Angular Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer)

- Vue: [eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility](https://github.com/vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to use an accessibility linter in a project?

###### ID143

A:: An accessibility linter automatically checks that a basic level of accessibility is met by your project and is relatively easy to set up.

Q:: (Cloze) For accessibility testing, it's recommended to set up and use {{c1::[axe-core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n5Ul7WPc3Y&list=PLMlWGnpsViOMt24a-Y_dybv68H-kj6Un6&t=1649s)}} or similar tools. If using Storybook, you can implement {{c2::[accessibility testing with Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/blog/accessibility-testing-with-storybook/)}}.

###### ID144

A:: (Cloze) Including accessibility checks in your tests helps catch any changes that affect your project's accessibility and audit score.

Q:: What are some examples of accessible design systems?

###### ID145

A:: Two examples of accessible design systems are:

1. [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/)

2. [Material Design](https://material.io/design)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to use an accessible design system?

###### ID146

A:: Accessible design systems provide components that are highly accessible out of the box, making it easier to maintain accessibility throughout your project.

Q:: What should be considered when agreeing on a minimum accessibility score for a project?

###### ID147

A:: When agreeing on a minimum accessibility score, consider your project's specific requirements. The score should be based on the results from tools like Lighthouse or axe, which use axe user impact assessments to determine the severity of accessibility issues.

Q:: Why is it important to ensure link names are accessible?

###### ID148

A:: Inaccessible link elements pose barriers to accessibility. Using aria-label to describe links can help make them more accessible to users relying on assistive technologies.

Q:: How should lists be structured for accessibility?

###### ID149

A:: Lists must have both parent and child elements to be valid. This is important because screen readers inform users when they come to a list and how many items are in the list.

Q:: Why is the correct semantic structure of headings important for accessibility?

###### ID150

A:: Headers convey the structure of the page. When applied correctly, the page becomes easier to navigate, especially for users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

Q:: (Cloze) Ensuring text elements have {{c1::sufficient contrast}} against the page background is important because some people with {{c2::low vision}} experience {{c3::low contrast}}, making it difficult to distinguish {{c4::outlines, borders, edges, and details}}.

###### ID151

A:: (Cloze) Text that is too close in luminance (brightness) to the background can be hard to read for these users.

Q:: Why is it necessary to provide alternative text for images?

###### ID152

A:: Screen readers have no way of translating an image into words that get read to the user, even if the image only consists of text. Therefore, it's necessary for images to have short, descriptive alt text so screen reader users can clearly understand the image's contents and purpose.

Q:: Where can more accessibility rules be found?

###### ID153

A:: More accessibility rules can be found at [Deque University's axe rules](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe).

#### Chapter 11 - Licensing

![licensing](../images/licensing.png)

Q:: (Cloze) When using resources in your project, it's important to ensure you have the {{c1::rights to use}} them. For libraries, look for licenses such as {{c2::MIT}}, {{c3::Apache}}, or {{c4::BSD}}.

###### ID154

A:: (Cloze) However, if you modify these libraries, you should review the license details carefully.

Q:: What potential legal issues should be considered when using images and videos in a project?

###### ID155

A:: Copyrighted images and videos may cause legal problems. It's important to ensure you have the right to use any visual content in your project.
