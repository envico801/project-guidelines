### Part I - Fundamentals

#### Chapter 1 - Git

![branching](../images/branching.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the best branch strategy for developing new features?

###### ID1

A:: =============================================  
**You should perform work in a feature branch**. This way, all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the `main` branch, allowing you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code.

**References**:
- [Feature branch workflow by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Which branch should be used as a starting point for feature branches?

###### ID2

A:: =============================================  
**You should branch out from `develop`**. This ensures that code in `master` will generally build without issues and can often be used directly for releases (though this may be overkill for smaller projects).

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) When working with Git, you should never push into {{c1::develop}} or {{c2::master}} branch. Instead, you should make a {{c3::Pull Request}}.

###### ID3

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Avoid pushing directly into `develop` or `master`. Instead, create a `Pull Request` to notify team members, enable peer-review, and open a discussion on the feature.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What preparations are necessary before pushing a feature and making a Pull Request?

###### ID4

A:: =============================================  
Update your local `develop` branch and perform an interactive rebase. This rebases the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and applies your local commits at the top of the history without creating a merge commit, ensuring a clean history.

**References**:
- [Merging vs Rebasing by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

Q:: =============================================  

##### When is it best to handle conflicts in Git?

###### ID5

A:: =============================================  
Resolve potential conflicts **during rebasing and before submitting a Pull Request**.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What Cleanup Steps Should Be Taken After Merging Feature Branches?

###### ID6

A:: =============================================  
After your feature branch has been merged (either through a Pull Request or direct merge), you should perform these cleanup steps:

1. Delete your local feature branch:
    ```sh
    git branch -d <branchname>
    ```

2. Delete the remote feature branch to avoid repository clutter:
    ```sh
    git push origin --delete <branchname>
    ```

3. Clean up any local branches that are no longer on the remote:
    ```sh
    git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv --no-color | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done
    ```

These steps ensure that:
- Your repository stays clean and organized
- You avoid accidentally reusing old feature branches
- Each feature branch is only merged once
- Your local repository accurately reflects the remote state

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Before making a Pull Request, ensure your feature branch {{c1::builds successfully}} and {{c2::passes all tests}}, including {{c3::code style checks}}.

###### ID7

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This reduces the risk of issues in the destination branch and improves code readability.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is a customized `.gitignore` file recommended?

###### ID8

A:: =============================================  
Use [this `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/.gitignore) as it excludes system files, editor settings, and common dependency folders that shouldn't be in a remote repository.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can `develop` and `master` branches be protected from accidental changes?

###### ID9

A:: =============================================  
Enable branch protection for `develop` and `master` to prevent unexpected and irreversible changes.

**References**:
- [GitHub - About protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/)
- [Bitbucket - Using branch permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html)
- [GitLab - Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should you initialize a new project with Git?

###### ID10

A:: =============================================  
In the project directory, initialize a git repository with these commands:

```sh
cd <project directory>
git init
```

*Note: Skip this step for subsequent features or changes.*

Q:: =============================================  

##### How do you create and manage a new feature or bug-fix branch in Git?

###### ID11

A:: =============================================  
1. Create a new branch:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
2. Branch Naming Conventions:
    - Features: `feature/add-login`
    - Bugs: `bugfix/auth-error`
3. Push to remote:
    ```sh
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```

<hr>
Best Practices:
- Create from updated `main`/`develop`
- Keep branches focused
- Use pull requests for review
- Delete after merging

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) In your Git workflow, stage specific files with {{c1::`git add <file1> <file2> ...`}}, then {{c2::record those changes}} with a commit.

###### ID12

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) `git add <file1> <file2> ...` - You should add only files that make up a small, coherent change. `git commit` starts an editor where you can separate the subject from the body.

**References**:
- *[Section 1.3](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines#13-writing-good-commit-messages)* for more information on commit structuring.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What Git command allows you to review each change before committing?

###### ID13

A:: =============================================  
Use `git add -p` to review each change individually and decide if it should be included in the commit.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How do you sync your branch with the remote repository to get the latest changes?

###### ID14

A:: =============================================  
To sync with the remote repository:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

This allows you to handle conflicts on your machine before rebasing or creating a Pull Request with conflicts.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of interactive rebasing in Git?

###### ID15

A:: =============================================  
Interactive rebasing is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to edit, combine, or reorder commits in your branch history before applying them to another branch. It is commonly used to clean up commit history, fix mistakes, or squash multiple commits into a single one to make the history more concise and easier to understand.

Interactive rebasing is often used to update a feature branch with the latest changes from a target branch (e.g., `develop`). For example, you can use the following commands:  
```
git checkout <branchname>  
git rebase -i --autosquash develop  
```  

#### What does the `-i` flag do?  
The `-i` flag stands for **interactive** mode. When used, it opens an editor where you can see a list of commits and choose actions to perform on each commit, such as:  
- **Reword**: Change the commit message.  
- **Pick**: Keep the commit as is.  
- **Squash**: Combine this commit with the previous one.  
- **Drop**: Remove the commit entirely.  
- **Edit**: Pause the rebase to make changes to the commit.  

Without the `-i` flag, Git performs a **non-interactive rebase**, meaning it automatically replays all commits from your branch onto the target branch (`develop` in this case) without giving you the opportunity to modify, reorder, or squash commits. This can be faster if no changes to the commit history are needed, but it lacks the flexibility to clean up or reorganize commits.

#### What does the `--autosquash` option do?  
The `--autosquash` option works in conjunction with interactive rebasing. It automatically groups and combines fixup commits (commits prefixed with `fixup!`) with their respective base commits during the rebase process. This ensures that the branch history is cleaner, with fewer intermediate commits, and helps maintain a more organized and professional commit log on the target branch.  

#### Use Case:  
By combining all related commits into a single, polished commit, interactive rebasing with `-i` and `--autosquash` keeps the `develop` branch cleaner and avoids clutter from multiple commits for a single feature.  

**References:**  
- Interactive rebasing with `--autosquash`  

**References**:
- [Interactive rebasing with autosquash](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) If you encounter conflicts during rebasing, you should {{c1::resolve them}} and then continue the rebase using {{c2::git rebase --continue}}.

###### ID16

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) To resolve conflicts:

```sh
git add <file1> <file2> ...
git rebase --continue
```

**References**:
- [GitHub guide to resolving merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is the `-f` flag needed when pushing after a rebase?

###### ID17

A:: =============================================  
After a rebase, Git rejects a normal `git push` due to changed history. Use the `-f` or `--force` flag to push:

```sh
git push -f
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is a safer alternative to `git push -f` if others are working on the branch?

###### ID18

A:: =============================================  
Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `-f` when others may also be working on the branch. It prevents overwriting changes someone else may have pushed.

**References**:
- [Explanation of `--force-with-lease`](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)
- [Web Archive (it will take some time to load)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180813203855/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should you structure the subject and body of Git Commit messages??

###### ID19

A:: =============================================  
Separate the **subject** from the **body** with a newline. Git will interpret the first line as the summary. You can use `git shortlog` to display only commit summaries.

**References**:
- [Guidelines for writing clear Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) When writing a commit message, limit the subject line to {{c1::50 characters}} and wrap the body at {{c2::72 characters}}.

###### ID20

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Keep commits focused and avoid verbosity.

**References**:
- [The 50/72 rule for commit messages](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule-8a906f61f09c)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the best practices for formatting commit message subject lines?

###### ID21

A:: =============================================  
<hr>

**Traditional Commit Message Rules**:

1. Capitalize the first word.

2. Avoid ending with a period.

3. Use the [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_Mood).

   - Example: `Add user authentication`

<hr>
**Conventional Commits Format ([Official Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/))**:

1. Structure: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
2. Common types include: 
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `style:` for formatting
   - `refactor:` for code restructuring
   - `test:` for test-related changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
3. Example: `feat(auth): add user login functionality`

<hr>
**References**:
- [conventional-commits-cheatsheet.md](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it important to use imperative mood in commit message subject lines?

###### ID22

A:: =============================================  
The imperative mood **frames the commit message as an instruction** for what will happen after it’s applied, rather than a record of what was done.

**References**:
- [Why use imperative mood in commit messages](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2079612)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What Should the Commit Message Body Focus on Explaining?

###### ID23

A:: =============================================  
The body of a commit message should explain **what** and **why** changes are made, rather than focusing on **how** they were implemented.

<hr>

Example of a poor commit message (focuses on how):
```
feat: Add user authentication

Created a new AuthService class
Added login() method with bcrypt
Modified UserController to use AuthService
Added password hashing function
```

<hr>

Example of a good commit message (focuses on what and why):
```
feat: Add user authentication

Implement secure user authentication to protect sensitive user data
and meet compliance requirements for our banking features.

This change:
- Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts
- Adds industry-standard password security
- Addresses security audit finding #45
- Sets foundation for upcoming 2FA feature
```

<hr>

Another good example:
```
fix: Update database connection timeout

Increase connection timeout from 5s to 30s to handle peak traffic
periods. Our monitoring shows connection failures during high load
times (>1000 concurrent users), causing customer complaints.

Related to incident #123
```

<hr>

The body should provide context that future maintainers would need to understand why this change was necessary, not just what files were modified or how the code works.

#### Chapter 2 - Documentation

![documentation](../images/documentation.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What template should be used for a `README.md` file?

###### ID24

A:: =============================================  
Use this [README.md template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md) as a starting point. Add additional sections if needed.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should documentation be organized for projects with multiple repositories?

###### ID25

A:: =============================================  
For multi-repository projects, include links to other repositories in each respective `README.md` file.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) How should the {{c1::README.md}} file be maintained as the project progresses?

###### ID26

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Keep the `README.md` file updated as the project evolves to ensure that documentation remains relevant and helpful throughout the project's lifecycle.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How Should Code Comments Be Used to Enhance Code Quality?

###### ID27

A:: =============================================  
Comments and clean code work together to create maintainable software. While code should be as readable as possible, comments serve specific purposes:

1. Explain the intent and reasoning:
    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment states the obvious
    function calculateTotal(items) {
        // Loop through items and add prices
        return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    }

    // GOOD - Comment explains the business logic
    function calculateTotal(items) {
        // Include bulk discount when order contains more than 10 items
        // This matches our Q4 2024 pricing strategy
        return items.reduce((sum, item) => 
            sum + item.getDiscountedPrice(items.length), 0);
    }
    ```
2. Clarify complex or non-obvious logic:
    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment just restates the code
    function calculateDateDifference(startDate, endDate) {
        // Subtract dates and convert to days
        return Math.floor((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }

    // GOOD - Explains domain-specific logic and edge cases
    function calculateDateDifference(startDate, endDate) {
        // For billing purposes, partial days are counted as full days
        // following financial regulation §34.2.1
        // e.g., 1.5 days = 2 days, 2.1 days = 3 days
        // This ensures compliance with contract terms requiring
        // minimum one-day billing even for same-day services
        return Math.ceil((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
    ```
3. Document why certain decisions were made:
    ```javascript
    // BAD - Comment explains implementation without context
    function sanitizeUserInput(input) {
        // Replace special characters and trim spaces
        return input.replace(/[<>]/g, '').trim();
    }

    // GOOD - Documents security decisions and their rationale
    function sanitizeUserInput(input) {
        /**
        * Custom sanitization implementation because:
        * 1. DOMPurify is too heavyweight for our use case
        *    (adds 45KB to bundle size)
        * 2. We only need to handle basic text inputs
        * 3. Full HTML sanitization happens server-side
        *
        * SECURITY NOTICE: This method is NOT sufficient for
        * sanitizing HTML content or preventing XSS in HTML contexts.
        * Review security policy SP-2024-03 before modifying.
        * Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/security-policies-connectors.html
        */
        return input.replace(/[<>]/g, '').trim();
    }
    ```

<hr>
**Remember**:
- Clean code reduces the need for obvious comments
- Comments should explain the "why" rather than the "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use comments to provide context that can't be expressed in code alone
- JSDoc comments for function documentation are still valuable even with clean code
```javascript
// GOOD - JSDoc provides clear documentation while code remains clean
/**
 * Processes customer refund requests according to company policy
 * @param {Object} transaction - Transaction details
 * @param {string} transaction.id - Transaction ID
 * @param {number} transaction.amount - Original transaction amount
 * @param {Date} transaction.date - Transaction date
 * @param {string} reason - Refund reason code
 * @returns {Object} Refund details including approved amount
 * @throws {PolicyViolationError} If refund violates company policy
 */
function processRefundRequest(transaction, reason) {
    // Implementation...
}
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### When should you include links to external discussions in your code comments?

###### ID28

A:: =============================================  
Include links to open discussions (e.g., on **GitHub** or **StackOverflow**) within comments when they provide helpful context or detail for the approach you're using.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Comments should not be used as an {{c1::excuse for bad code}}. Instead, you should {{c2::keep your code clean}}.

###### ID29

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Focus on **keeping code clean** so that comments enhance, rather than compensate for, code quality.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should comments be maintained as code evolves?

###### ID30

A:: =============================================  
Update or remove comments as your code changes to keep them relevant and accurate. Outdated comments can be misleading, so they should evolve alongside the code they describe.

#### Chapter 3 - Environments

![laptop](../images/laptop.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the three main environments commonly defined in a project?

###### ID31

A:: =============================================  
The three main environments typically defined are `development`, `test`, and `production`.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it essential to define separate environments in a project?

###### ID32

A:: =============================================  
Different environments often require distinct configurations, such as data sources, tokens, APIs, and ports. For example, `development` mode might use a fake API for testing, while `production` may have Google Analytics enabled.

**References**:
- [Learn more about environment-specific configs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8332333/node-js-setting-up-environment-specific-configs-to-be-used-with-everyauth)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Why should deployment-specific configurations be loaded from {{c1::environment variables}} instead of added as constants in the codebase?

###### ID33

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Loading configurations from environment variables keeps sensitive information, such as tokens and passwords, outside the codebase, which is essential for security.

**References**:
- [Sample configuration](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/config.sample.js)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should environment variables be handled in a project?

###### ID34

A:: =============================================  
Store environment variables in `.env` files and exclude them from version control using `.gitignore`. Commit a `.env.example` file as a guide for developers, and set environment variables through standard means for production.

**References**:
- [Guide to managing environment variables in Node.js](https://medium.com/@rafaelvidaurre/managing-environment-variables-in-node-js-2cb45a55195f)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it advised to validate environment variables before the app starts?

###### ID35

A:: =============================================  
Validating environment variables can prevent long troubleshooting sessions by catching errors early. Libraries like `joi` can be helpful for validating these values.

**References**:
- [Sample configuration with validation](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/configWithTest.sample.js)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) To specify the node version for a project, set it in the {{c1::engines}} field of {{c2::package.json}}.

###### ID36

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This clarifies the required node version for the project.

**References**:
- [npm documentation on engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#engines)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of using `nvm` and a `.nvmrc` file in a project?

###### ID37

A:: =============================================  
A `.nvmrc` file and `nvm` allow users to switch to the correct node version with `nvm use`, ensuring a consistent environment.

**Note**: `nvm` allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.

**References**:
- [nvm repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why should a `preinstall` script be added to a project?

###### ID38

A:: =============================================  
A `preinstall` script that checks node and npm versions helps avoid dependency issues, which can arise if dependencies are installed with incompatible npm versions.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the benefits of using Docker in a project?

###### ID39

A:: =============================================  
Docker provides a consistent environment across development, testing, and production, minimizing dependency and configuration issues.

**References**:
- [Guide to Dockerizing a Node.js application](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-dockerize-a-node-js-application-4fbab45a0c19)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it preferable to use local modules instead of globally installed ones?

###### ID40

A:: =============================================  
Local modules ensure that tooling is shared among team members, avoiding the need for each person to install global dependencies on their own systems.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) To ensure consistent dependencies across a team, use {{c1::package-lock.json}} on {{c2::npm@5}} or higher, or alternatively use {{c3::Yarn}}.

###### ID41

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This guarantees that all team members have the exact same dependencies, ensuring uniform code behavior across development environments.

**References**:
- [Guide to consistent dependencies across teams](https://kostasbariotis.com/consistent-dependencies-across-teams/)
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can you ensure consistent dependencies when using older versions of npm?

###### ID42

A:: =============================================  
For older versions of npm, use `--save --save-exact` when installing a new dependency and create an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file before publishing. This will lock dependencies to specific versions, similar to `package-lock.json` in newer npm versions.

**References**:
- [npm documentation on package locks](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks)

A:: =============================================  
Discuss using any lesser-known dependencies with the team to ensure alignment and evaluate potential risks or alternatives.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) To ensure your app works with the latest version of its dependencies without breaking, use the command {{c1::npm outdated}}.

###### ID49

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Use the command `npm outdated` to verify if any dependencies need updating, which can help keep your project current with the latest patches and features.

**References**:
- [npm outdated command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it beneficial to update dependencies one at a time?

###### ID50

A:: =============================================  
Updating dependencies one by one simplifies troubleshooting, making it easier to identify and resolve issues if something goes wrong.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What tool can simplify the process of updating npm packages?

###### ID51

A:: =============================================  
The [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) tool can help manage npm package updates more efficiently.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can you check for security vulnerabilities in npm packages?

###### ID52

A:: =============================================  
Use tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test?utm_source=risingstack_blog) to scan for known security vulnerabilities in npm packages.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) When updating dependencies, it's important to always check their {{c1::release notes}} when updates show up to be aware of potential {{c2::breaking changes}}.

###### ID53

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This helps you anticipate and handle compatibility issues that may arise from updates.

#### Chapter 5 - Testing

![testing](../images/testing.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is a separate `test` mode environment often necessary?

###### ID54

A:: =============================================  
A separate `test` mode environment can help avoid issues such as:

1. Preventing test data from affecting production analytics or dashboards.

2. Avoiding production API rate limits, which might block test calls if exceeded.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Test files should be placed {{c1::next to the tested modules}} using the naming convention {{c2::\*.test.js}} or {{c3::\*.spec.js}}.

###### ID55

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This organization makes it easy to locate tests without navigating through complex folder structures.

**References**:
- [Read more on code structure for testability](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Where should additional test files that don’t relate to specific files be stored?

###### ID56

A:: =============================================  
Store additional test files in a separate folder, usually named `__test__`, to keep them distinct from specific implementation files and reduce confusion.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is the `__test__` folder name widely adopted?

###### ID57

A:: =============================================  
The `__test__` folder name is considered a standard convention and is automatically recognized by many JavaScript testing frameworks.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the key characteristics of testable code?

###### ID58

A:: =============================================  
Testable code should:

1. Avoid side effects.
2. Extract side effects to isolated functions.
3. Make use of pure functions for predictable results.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) A {{c1::pure function}} is a function that always returns the {{c2::same output}} for the {{c3::same input}} and has no side effects.

###### ID59

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) In contrast, an impure function may rely on external factors or cause side effects, making it less predictable.

**References**:
- [Read more on testable JavaScript code](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it beneficial to use pure functions for testable code?

###### ID60

A:: =============================================  
Pure functions make your code more reliable by allowing you to:

1. Test business logic independently as isolated units.
2. Minimize the impact of randomness and external conditions, which could reduce test reliability.

##### When and why should you run tests during the development workflow?

###### ID62

A:: =============================================  
<hr>

**Run tests**:

1. Locally before creating pull requests to the `develop` branch

2. After performing a `rebase`

3. Before pushing code to a remote repository

<hr>
**Benefits**:

- Ensures code changes are stable
- Reduces potential integration issues
- Prevents build failures on production-ready branches
- Catches errors early in the development process
- Maintains the quality of the shared codebase

This approach helps catch and resolve potential problems before they impact other team members or CI/CD pipelines.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is test documentation important?

###### ID63

A:: =============================================  
Documenting tests provides clarity and context, making it easier for other developers, DevOps, QA, and future contributors to understand and run tests effectively.

#### Chapter 6 - Structure and Naming

![folder-tree](../images/folder-tree.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should project files be organized?

###### ID64

A:: =============================================  
Organize files around product `features`, `pages`, or `components`, rather than by role. Place test files next to the code they test.

<hr>

**Bad**

```
.
├── controllers
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
├── models
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
```

**Good**

```
.
├── product
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── product.js
|   └── product.test.js
├── user
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── user.js
|   └── user.test.js
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) In a well-organized project structure, you should create {{c1::small modules}} that {{c2::encapsulate one responsibility}} including its {{c3::test}}.

###### ID65

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This structure makes it easier to navigate and find files quickly.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Config files should be placed in a {{c1::./config}} folder, and you should {{c2::not make different config files}} for {{c3::different environments}}.

###### ID66

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Manage configuration based on purpose (e.g., database, API) for a scalable approach.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should values for configuration files be supplied?

###### ID67

A:: =============================================  
Use environment variables to provide values for config files, keeping configuration flexible and secure.

**References**:
- [Read more on configuration management](https://medium.com/@fedorHK/no-config-b3f1171eecd5)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How Should Project Scripts Be Organized and Why?

###### ID68

A:: =============================================  
<hr>

Place all project scripts (bash, node, etc.) in a dedicated `./scripts` folder for better organization. This practice offers several benefits:

```
project/
├── scripts/
│   ├── build/
│   │   ├── production.js
│   │   └── development.js
│   ├── db/
│   │   ├── migrate.sh
│   │   ├── seed.js
│   │   └── sync.sh
│   ├── deploy/
│   │   ├── staging.sh
│   │   └── production.sh
│   └── tests/
│       ├── e2e.js
│       └── setup-test-db.sh
├── src/
└── package.json
```

<hr>
Common script categories include:
- Build scripts (production, development, staging)
- Database management (migrations, seeding, backups)
- Deployment automation
- Test setup and execution
- Development environment setup
- Code generation tools
- CI/CD helpers

<hr>
This organization:
- Makes scripts easily discoverable
- Prevents cluttering the root directory
- Allows for logical grouping of related scripts
- Simplifies script management in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:prod": "node scripts/build/production.js",
    "build:dev": "node scripts/build/development.js",
    "db:migrate": "bash scripts/db/migrate.sh",
    "db:seed": "node scripts/db/seed.js",
    "deploy:staging": "bash scripts/deploy/staging.sh"
  }
}
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### How Should Build Output Be Managed in Version Control?

###### ID69

A:: =============================================  
<hr>

Build output should follow these conventions:

```
project/
├── build/          # Contains generated files
│   ├── dist/       # Distribution-ready files
│   ├── temp/       # Temporary build artifacts
│   └── reports/    # Build reports and stats
├── src/            # Source code
└── .gitignore      # Git configuration
```

<hr>
Example `.gitignore` entry:
```gitignore
# Ignore all build output
/build
# Exceptions (if any)
!/build/.gitkeep
```

<hr>
Reasons for not committing build output:
1. **Reproducibility**: Build files can be regenerated by any team member using the source code and build scripts
2. **Version Control Efficiency**:
   - Prevents repository bloat
   - Avoids unnecessary merge conflicts
   - Keeps commit history focused on actual code changes
3. **Build Environment Consistency**:
   - Ensures everyone uses the same build process
   - Prevents issues from environment-specific builds
4. **CI/CD Best Practices**:
   - Builds should be performed in CI/CD pipelines
   - Each deployment should use freshly built files

<hr>
**Exceptions where you might commit build output**:
- GitHub Pages requiring built static files
- Documentation sites that need pre-built assets
- Libraries that provide pre-built distributions for convenience

In these cases, document the exception in the repository **README** and consider using git submodules or dedicated branches for built files.

#### Chapter 7 - Code Style

![code-style](../images/code-style.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What JavaScript syntax is recommended for new projects?

###### ID70

A:: =============================================  
Use stage-2 or higher (modern) JavaScript syntax for new projects. For older projects, remain consistent with the existing syntax unless you intend to modernize the project.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why should stage-2 and higher JavaScript syntax be used?

###### ID71

A:: =============================================  
Stage-2 syntax is more stable and likely to become part of the official JavaScript specification, often with minor changes. Transpilers allow projects to leverage these features even before full browser support.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Code style checks should be included in your {{c1::build process}}.

###### ID72

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Enforcing style checks in builds ensures consistency across client and server-side code. [Learn more](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What tool is recommended to enforce JavaScript code style?

###### ID73

A:: =============================================  
Use [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style in JavaScript projects.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is ESLint preferred for enforcing code style?

###### ID74

A:: =============================================  
ESLint offers extensive support for rules, customization options, and custom rule additions, making it highly flexible for enforcing code style.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Which JavaScript Style Guide is recommended?

###### ID75

A:: =============================================  
The [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is recommended for consistency and best practices.

**Additional Resources:**
- [More on Airbnb’s guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#resources)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of the `.eslintignore` file?

###### ID76

A:: =============================================  
Use the `.eslintignore` file to exclude specific files or folders from code style checks, avoiding the need for `eslint-disable` comments within the code.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What should be done with `eslint` disable comments before submitting a Pull Request?

###### ID77

A:: =============================================  
Remove all `eslint` disable comments before submitting a Pull Request to maintain code quality and style standards.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should small tasks be marked in the code?

###### ID78

A:: =============================================  
Use `//TODO:` comments for small tasks. For larger tasks, use `//TODO(#3456)`, where the number corresponds to an open ticket for tracking.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Comments should be {{c1::kept relevant}} as code changes, and {{c2::commented blocks of code}} should be {{c3::removed}}.

###### ID79

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Code should be as readable as possible without distractions. If a function is refactored, remove the old code instead of commenting it out.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why should irrelevant or humorous comments, logs, or names be avoided?

###### ID80

A:: =============================================  
Avoid irrelevant or humorous comments, logs, or naming. While these may be removed during the build process, source code might be handed to a different company or client, who may not appreciate this style.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What naming convention is recommended for functions?

###### ID81

A:: =============================================  
Use long, descriptive names for functions. A function name should be a verb or verb phrase that clearly communicates its intention and functionality.

**References**:
- [Function names should say what they do](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#function-names-should-say-what-they-do)
- [Anki deck created from this repository](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/297764056)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should functions be organized within a file?

###### ID82

A:: =============================================  
Organize functions in a file according to the **step-down rule**, **placing higher-level functions at the top and lower-level functions below** for readability and logical flow.

```javascript
// Higher-level function at the top
function processUserData(userData) {
  const validatedData = validateUserInput(userData);
  const normalizedData = normalizeUserData(validatedData);
  return saveToDatabase(normalizedData);
}

// Mid-level supporting functions
function validateUserInput(userData) {
  validateEmail(userData.email);
  validateAge(userData.age);
  return userData;
}

function normalizeUserData(userData) {
  return {
    email: userData.email.toLowerCase(),
    age: Number(userData.age),
    lastUpdated: new Date()
  };
}

// Lower-level utility functions at the bottom
function validateEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email format');
  }
}

function validateAge(age) {
  if (age < 0 || age > 120) {
    throw new Error('Invalid age');
  }
}

function saveToDatabase(data) {
  // Database saving logic here
  return data;
}
```

<hr>
This example shows how to organize functions with:
1. The main high-level function `processUserData` at the top, which describes the overall business logic
2. Supporting functions `validateUserInput` and `normalizeUserData` in the middle
3. Utility functions like `validateEmail`, `validateAge`, and `saveToDatabase` at the bottom

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of a `.editorconfig` file?

###### ID83

A:: =============================================  
A [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs within a project. It defines coding styles and integrates well with version control systems, making it easy for developers to adhere to set conventions.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can editors be set up to flag code style errors?

###### ID84

A:: =============================================  
Use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) with ESLint to integrate Prettier and receive notifications for code style issues within the editor. [Read more](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation).

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why consider using Git hooks in your workflow?

###### ID85

A:: =============================================  
Git hooks improve productivity by automating certain checks before code commits, reducing the chance of breaking builds in staging or production environments. [Learn more about Git hooks](http://githooks.com/).

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the benefit of using Prettier with a precommit hook?

###### ID86

A:: =============================================  
Using Prettier with a precommit hook, along with `lint-staged` and `husky`, streamlines the process of code formatting. This setup saves time, as Prettier runs automatically before each commit, ensuring code consistency across the project. [More on `lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and [on `husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

#### Chapter 8 - Logging

![logging](../images/logging.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it important to avoid client-side console logs in production?

###### ID87

A:: =============================================  
While the build process should remove them, it's essential to have code style checks that flag any leftover console logs, preventing unintentional logging in production.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the recommended method for logging in production environments?

###### ID88

A:: =============================================  
Use logging libraries like [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for production logging. These tools enhance readability and manage logs more effectively than console logs.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the advantages of using logging libraries in production?

###### ID89

A:: =============================================  
Logging libraries improve the troubleshooting experience by offering features like colorization, timestamps, file-based logging alongside console logging, and even daily log rotation. [Read more on logging best practices](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/).

#### Chapter 9 - API

![api](../images/api.png)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the core components of resource-oriented API design?

###### ID90

A:: =============================================  
The three main components in resource-oriented API design are:

1. **Resources**: Have data, may be nested, and have methods for operation.
2. **Collections**: Groups of resources.
3. **URLs**: Identify the online location of resources or collections.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What advantages does resource-oriented design offer for API development?

###### ID91

A:: =============================================  
Resource-oriented design benefits API development by:

1. Being **familiar to developers**, who are the primary API users.
2. Improving **readability and ease of use**.
3. Supporting **generic libraries and connectors** without requiring detailed API structure knowledge.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Which naming convention should be used for URLs and resource names in API design?

###### ID92

A:: =============================================  
Use **kebab-case** for URLs and **plural kebab-case** for resource names within URLs.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the recommended case for query string parameters and resource fields?

###### ID93

A:: =============================================  
Use **camelCase** for parameters in query strings or resource fields.

**Examples**:
- Query string parameters:
  ```
  https://api.example.com/users?firstName=John&lastName=Doe&sortBy=createdDate
  ```

- JSON resource fields:
  ```json
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "createdDate": "2023-11-21",
    "contactInfo": {
      "phoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
      "emailAddress": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }
  ```

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why should plural nouns be used for collection URLs in APIs?

###### ID94

A:: =============================================  
Plural nouns (e.g., `/users`) in collection URLs enhance readability and provide a consistent URL structure.

**References**:
- [RESTful API Design: Plural Nouns and Concrete Names](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-plural-nouns-and-concrete-names)
- [Web Archive (it will take some time to load)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190103073743/https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-plural-nouns-and-concrete-names)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should plural nouns be used in variables and properties within source code?

###### ID95

A:: =============================================  
In source code, represent plural collections with variables or properties by adding a List suffix. **Plural naming in URLs is clearer, though in code, it can lead to subtle errors**.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the recommended URL format for identifying specific resources?

###### ID96

A:: =============================================  
Use a **singular resource** that begins with a **collection** and ends with an **identifier**, for example:

```
/students/245743
/airports/kjfk
```

Avoid formats like:

```
GET /blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId/summary
```

> This structure targets a _**property**_ rather than a resource. Instead, include the property as a parameter to simplify responses.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) In API design, it’s recommended to exclude {{c1::verbs}} from {{c2::resource URLs}} to avoid {{c3::an excess of URLs}} and {{c4::inconsistent patterns}}.

###### ID97

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Excluding verbs from resource URLs **helps developers learn the API** more easily. In API design, verbs serve a different purpose.

Q:: =============================================  

##### When are verbs appropriate in API URLs?

###### ID98

A:: =============================================  
Use verbs in **non-resource URLs** when the endpoint doesn’t return a resource but performs an action, delivering the result. These are not CRUD operations. Example:

```
/translate?text=Hallo
```

> For CRUD operations, use HTTP methods on resource or collection URLs. Verbs in this context generally refer to **Controllers**, and typically only a few are needed.

**References**:
- [API Guidelines: Controller Usage](https://github.com/byrondover/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md#controller)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the best practice for JSON property names in request and response bodies?

###### ID99

A:: =============================================  
Use **camelCase** for JSON property names in request and response bodies to maintain consistency, especially as JavaScript is typically used for JSON parsing and generation.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why should table and column names be avoided as resource names and properties in APIs?

###### ID100

A:: =============================================  
Avoid using `table_name` for resource names and `column_name` for resource properties because **an API should expose resources rather than the underlying database schema**. This abstraction helps keep the API design separate from database structure.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should HTTP methods represent CRUD operations in API design?

###### ID101

A:: =============================================  
Represent CRUD operations with HTTP methods as follows:

- **GET**: Retrieve a resource's representation.
- **POST**: Create new resources or sub-resources.
- **PUT**: Update existing resources.
- **PATCH**: Partially update existing resources with specified fields.
- **DELETE**: Remove existing resources.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the best way to structure URLs for nested resources?

###### ID102

A:: =============================================  
For nested resources, use URLs that represent the relationship between them. Examples:

- `GET /schools/2/students` retrieves all students from school with ID 2.
- `GET /schools/2/students/31` retrieves details of student 31 from school 2.
- `DELETE /schools/2/students/31` removes student 31 from school 2.
- `PUT /schools/2/students/31` updates information for student 31. Only use `PUT` on resource URLs, not on collections.
- `POST /schools` creates a new school and returns details of the newly created school. Use `POST` on collection URLs.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should API versioning be implemented in URLs?

###### ID103

A:: =============================================  
Use an **ordinal number with a "v" prefix** (e.g., `v1`, `v2`) for versioning and place it at the beginning of the URL to give it **higher scope**. For example:

```
http://api.domain.com/v1/schools/3/students
```

> Versioning is helpful for public APIs as it allows changes without breaking existing implementations that third-party services rely on.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) An effective error message response in an API should include a {{c1::code}}, a {{c2::message}}, and a {{c3::description}}. For validation errors, it should also include an {{c4::errors}} array with detailed information on each error.

###### ID104

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Providing structured error responses helps developers troubleshoot issues.

<hr>

An example error message might look like:

```json
{
  "code": 1234,
  "message": "An error occurred",
  "description": "Additional details here"
}
```

<hr>

Or for validation errors:

```json
{
  "code": 2314,
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1233,
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Invalid email address"
    },
    {
      "code": 1234,
      "field": "password",
      "message": "Password is required"
    }
  ]
}
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### What key HTTP status codes should be used in API responses, and what do they indicate?

###### ID105

A:: =============================================  
Key HTTP status codes include:

- **200 OK**: Successful `GET`, `PUT`, or `POST` requests.
- **201 Created**: New resource successfully created (used with `POST`).
- **204 No Content**: Success with no content to return (common for `DELETE` success).
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates a cached version can be used, reducing data transfer.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be understood or was incorrect.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Request is missing valid credentials; re-authentication needed.
- **403 Forbidden**: Server understood the request but refuses authorization.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A valid request could not be processed due to server error.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can API responses limit the data they return?

###### ID106

A:: =============================================  
Use a **fields query parameter** to specify a comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. For example:

```
GET /students?fields=id,name,age,class
```

This limits the data returned, improving performance and minimizing data transfer.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) In API design, it’s recommended to provide {{c1::total numbers of resources}} in your response and to accept {{c2::limit}} and {{c3::offset}} parameters for {{c4::pagination}}.

###### ID107

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) For resources that support filtering and sorting, document these capabilities, although they need not be available for all resources at the start.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it essential to use common HTTP status codes in API responses?

###### ID108

A:: =============================================  
Using **common HTTP status codes** is important because most developers don't memorize all HTTP status codes. Relying on a familiar subset prevents developers from needing to look up each code's meaning, making workflows more efficient. This practice also aligns with the limited subset used by most API providers for consistency.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should security exceptions be represented in API response messages?

###### ID109

A:: =============================================  
**Use generic messages** for security exceptions to avoid disclosing sensitive information. For instance, **instead of saying "incorrect password", use a message like "invalid username or password"** to prevent revealing that the username is correct.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it unsafe to use basic authentication without HTTPS?

###### ID110

A:: =============================================  
Avoid basic authentication over unsecured connections, as it transmits the user ID and password in plain text (encoded in base64, which is easily reversible). Without HTTPS, this information can be intercepted, posing a significant security risk.

**References**:
- [Importance of HTTPS for Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the best way to include authentication tokens in API requests?

###### ID111

A:: =============================================  
Include **authentication tokens** in each request using the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx, Extra yyyyy`). **Avoid placing tokens in the URL** to minimize security risks.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) To maximize API security, {{c1::Authorization Code}} should be {{c2::short-lived}}, and all {{c3::non-TLS requests}} should be rejected with a {{c4::403 Forbidden}} response.

###### ID112

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) Following these practices reduces **unauthorized access** risks and ensures **data integrity** over secure, encrypted connections.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is Rate Limiting a key element for API security?

###### ID113

A:: =============================================  
**Rate Limiting** protects your API from bot attacks and excessive requests. By setting rate limits **early in API development**, you help prevent abuse and conserve resources effectively.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What steps should an API take to handle incoming data securely?

###### ID114

A:: =============================================  
An API should **normalize received data** or reject it if it doesn't meet standards. When errors occur due to bad or missing data, the API should respond with a **400 Bad Request** and include relevant error details.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is JSON serialization a security necessity for API responses?

###### ID115

A:: =============================================  
**JSON serialization** prevents potential JavaScript **remote code execution** in both browsers and Node.js environments. A proper serializer ensures **user-supplied data** is encoded accurately, blocking unintended execution of such data on the client side.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) When validating the content-type in API requests, prioritize accepting {{c1::application/\*json}}. Allowing other MIME types like {{c2::application/x-www-form-urlencoded}} can enable attackers to {{c3::create a form and trigger a `POST` request}}.

###### ID116

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) The server should **never assume the Content-Type**. If the Content-Type header is missing or incorrect, respond with a **4XX error** to reject unsupported content.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can HTTP headers enhance API security?

###### ID117

A:: =============================================  
Setting HTTP headers appropriately can help secure your API by restricting shared information. The Helmet project provides middleware for Express apps that configures headers to bolster security.

**References**:
- [Helmet Middleware for HTTP Header Security](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How can APIs ensure robust data validation?

###### ID118

A:: =============================================  
APIs should validate **all data exchanged**—including both incoming requests and outgoing responses—to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and security.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Where is a reliable checklist for API security practices available?

###### ID119

A:: =============================================  
The API Security Checklist Project offers a detailed list of best practices for securing APIs effectively.

**References**:
- [README.md Template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md#api-reference)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should API authentication methods be represented in documentation?

###### ID121

A:: =============================================  
API authentication methods should be documented **with a code sample** to demonstrate proper usage clearly.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What structure information should be included when explaining an API's URL format?

###### ID122

A:: =============================================  
When explaining the **URL structure** of an API, include the **path** (excluding the root URL) and specify the **HTTP request method** for each endpoint.

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should API documentation address URL parameters?

###### ID123

A:: =============================================  
Document URL parameters by:

- Specifying whether they are required or optional
- Naming each parameter and indicating its data type

For example:

```
Required: id=[integer]
Optional: photo_id=[alphanumeric]
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) For `POST` requests in API documentation, provide {{c1::working examples}} and categorize parameters into {{c2::Optional}} and {{c3::Required}} sections.

###### ID124

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) This approach helps users understand how to structure `POST` requests properly.

Q:: =============================================  

##### What should be outlined in the Success Response section of API documentation?

###### ID125

A:: =============================================  
The Success Response section should include:

- The expected status code
- Any return data expected

For example:

```
Code: 200
Content: { id : 12 }
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### How should API documentation detail potential error responses?

###### ID126

A:: =============================================  
Document Error Responses by including:

- Possible failure scenarios for each endpoint (e.g., unauthorized access, incorrect parameters)
- Error code, message, and description for each type of error

For example:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authentication failed",
  "description": "Invalid username or password"
}
```

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is documenting all potential error responses crucial for API usability?

###### ID127

A:: =============================================  
Documenting all possible error responses helps **avoid assumptions** by API users and sets **clear expectations** for handling potential failures.

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) Name two widely used tools for API documentation: {{c1::API Blueprint}} and {{c2::Swagger}}.

###### ID128

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) These tools support creating standardized, accessible API documentation.
