### Part I - Fundamentals

#### Chapter 1 - Git

![branching](../images/branching.png)

Q:: What type of branch is best for feature development?

###### ID1

A:: You should perform work in a feature branch. This way, all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch, allowing you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code.

**References:**
- [Feature branch workflow by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

Q:: Which branch should be used as a starting point for feature branches?

###### ID2

A:: You should branch out from `develop`. This ensures that code in `master` will generally build without issues and can often be used directly for releases (though this may be overkill for smaller projects).

Q:: (Cloze) When working with Git, you should never push into {{c1::develop}} or {{c2::master}} branch. Instead, you should make a {{c3::Pull Request}}.

###### ID3

A:: (Cloze) Avoid pushing directly into `develop` or `master`. Instead, create a `Pull Request` to notify team members, enable peer-review, and open a discussion on the feature.

Q:: What preparations are necessary before pushing a feature and making a Pull Request?

###### ID4

A:: Update your local `develop` branch and perform an interactive rebase. This rebases the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and applies your local commits at the top of the history without creating a merge commit, ensuring a clean history.

**References:**
- [Merging vs Rebasing by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

Q:: When is it best to handle conflicts in Git?

###### ID5

A:: Resolve potential conflicts during rebasing and before submitting a Pull Request.

Q:: What should be done with feature branches after they are merged?

###### ID6

A:: Delete both local and remote feature branches after merging to avoid cluttering up your list of branches with inactive branches, and ensure that each feature branch is only merged once.

Q:: (Cloze) Before making a Pull Request, ensure your feature branch {{c1::builds successfully}} and {{c2::passes all tests}}, including {{c3::code style checks}}.

###### ID7

A:: (Cloze) Ensure your feature branch `builds successfully` and `passes all tests`, including `code style checks`. This reduces the risk of issues in the destination branch and improves code readability.

Q:: Why is a customized `.gitignore` file recommended?

###### ID8

A:: Use [this `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/.gitignore) as it excludes system files, editor settings, and common dependency folders that shouldn't be in a remote repository.

Q:: How can `develop` and `master` branches be protected from accidental changes?

###### ID9

A:: Enable branch protection for `develop` and `master` to prevent unexpected and irreversible changes.

**References:**
- [GitHub - About protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/)
- [Bitbucket - Using branch permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html)
- [GitLab - Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html)

Q:: How should you initialize a new project with Git?

###### ID10

A:: In the project directory, initialize a git repository with these commands:

```sh
cd <project directory>
git init
```

*Note: Skip this step for subsequent features or changes.*

Q:: How do you create a new feature or bug-fix branch in Git?

###### ID11

A:: Use the following command to create a new feature or bug-fix branch:

```sh
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

Q:: (Cloze) When making changes in Git, you should use {{c1::git add <file1> <file2> ...}} to add files, followed by {{c2::git commit}} to commit the changes.

###### ID12

A:: (Cloze) `git add <file1> <file2> ...` - You should add only files that make up a small, coherent change. `git commit` starts an editor where you can separate the subject from the body.

References:
- *[Section 1.3](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines#13-writing-good-commit-messages)* for more information on commit structuring.

Q:: What Git command allows you to review each change before committing?

###### ID13

A:: Use `git add -p` to review each change individually and decide if it should be included in the commit.

Q:: How do you sync your branch with the remote repository to get the latest changes?

###### ID14

A:: To sync with the remote repository:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

This allows you to handle conflicts on your machine before rebasing or creating a Pull Request with conflicts.

Q:: What is the purpose of interactive rebasing in Git?

###### ID15

A:: Interactive rebasing updates your feature branch with the latest changes from `develop`. Use:

```sh
git checkout <branchname>
git rebase -i --autosquash develop
```

The `--autosquash` option combines all commits into a single one. This keeps the `develop` branch cleaner and avoids multiple commits for one feature.

References:
- [Interactive rebasing with autosquash](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits)

Q:: (Cloze) If you encounter conflicts during rebasing, you should {{c1::resolve them}} and then continue the rebase using {{c2::git rebase --continue}}.

###### ID16

A:: (Cloze) To resolve conflicts:

```sh
git add <file1> <file2> ...
git rebase --continue
```

References:
- [GitHub guide to resolving merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)

Q:: Why is the `-f` flag needed when pushing after a rebase?

###### ID17

A:: After a rebase, Git rejects a normal `git push` due to changed history. Use the `-f` or `--force` flag to push:

```sh
git push -f
```

Q:: What is a safer alternative to `git push -f` if others are working on the branch?

###### ID18

A:: Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `-f` when others may also be working on the branch. It prevents overwriting changes someone else may have pushed.

References:
- [Explanation of `--force-with-lease`](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)

Q:: What steps should you take after your Pull Request has been accepted and merged?

###### ID19

A:: Final steps include:

1. Deleting your local feature branch:

```sh
git branch -d <branchname>
```

2. Cleaning up branches no longer on the remote:

```sh
git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv --no-color | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done
```

Q:: How should you format a Git commit message for clarity?

###### ID20

A:: Separate the subject from the body with a newline. Git will interpret the first line as the summary. You can use `git shortlog` to display only commit summaries.

References:
- [Guidelines for writing clear Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)

Q:: (Cloze) When writing a commit message, limit the subject line to {{c1::50 characters}} and wrap the body at {{c2::72 characters}}.

###### ID21

A:: (Cloze) Limit the subject line to `50 characters` and wrap the body at `72 characters`. Keep commits focused and avoid verbosity.

**References:**
- [The 50/72 rule for commit messages](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule-8a906f61f09c)

Q:: What are the formatting rules for a commit message subject line?

###### ID22

A:: Follow these rules for the subject line of a commit message:

1. Capitalize the first word.
2. Avoid ending with a period.
3. Use the [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).

Q:: Why is it important to use imperative mood in commit message subject lines?

###### ID23

A:: The imperative mood frames the commit message as an instruction for what will happen after it’s applied, rather than a record of what was done.

**References:**
- [Why use imperative mood in commit messages](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2079612)

Q:: What should the commit message body focus on explaining?

###### ID24

A:: The body of a commit message should explain **what** and **why** changes are made, rather than focusing on **how** they were implemented.

#### Chapter 2 - Documentation

![documentation](../images/documentation.png)

Q:: What template should be used for a `README.md` file?

###### ID25

A:: Use this [README.md template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md) as a starting point. Add additional sections if needed.

Q:: How should documentation be organized for projects with multiple repositories?

###### ID26

A:: For multi-repository projects, include links to other repositories in each respective `README.md` file.

Q:: (Cloze) How should the {{c1::README.md}} file be maintained as the project progresses?

###### ID27

A:: (Cloze) Keep the `README.md` file updated as the project evolves to ensure that documentation remains relevant and helpful throughout the project's lifecycle.

Q:: What is the primary purpose of adding comments to your code?

###### ID28

A:: Comment your code to clarify the intent behind each major section, enhancing understanding for others and for future reference.

Q:: When should you include links to external discussions in your code comments?

###### ID29

A:: Include links to open discussions (e.g., on GitHub or StackOverflow) within comments when they provide helpful context or detail for the approach you're using.

Q:: (Cloze) Comments should not be used as an {{c1::excuse for bad code}}. Instead, you should {{c2::keep your code clean}}.

###### ID30

A:: (Cloze) Comments should not be used as an **excuse for bad code**. Instead, focus on **keeping code clean** so that comments enhance, rather than compensate for, code quality.

Q:: How should clean code and comments work together?

###### ID31

A:: Clean code should not replace comments entirely. While code should be as readable as possible, comments are still needed to provide context and clarify complex or non-obvious logic.

Q:: How should comments be maintained as code evolves?

###### ID32

A:: Update or remove comments as your code changes to keep them relevant and accurate. Outdated comments can be misleading, so they should evolve alongside the code they describe.

#### Chapter 3 - Environments

![laptop](../images/laptop.png)

Q:: What are the three main environments commonly defined in a project?

###### ID33

A:: The three main environments typically defined are `development`, `test`, and `production`.

Q:: Why is it essential to define separate environments in a project?

###### ID34

A:: Different environments often require distinct configurations, such as data sources, tokens, APIs, and ports. For example, `development` mode might use a fake API for testing, while `production` may have Google Analytics enabled.

**References:**
- [Learn more about environment-specific configs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8332333/node-js-setting-up-environment-specific-configs-to-be-used-with-everyauth)

Q:: (Cloze) Why should deployment-specific configurations be loaded from {{c1::environment variables}} instead of added as {{c2::constants}} in the codebase?

###### ID35

A:: (Cloze) Loading configurations from environment variables keeps sensitive information, such as tokens and passwords, outside the codebase, which is essential for security.

**References:**
- [Sample configuration](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/config.sample.js)

Q:: How should environment variables be handled in a project?

###### ID36

A:: Store environment variables in `.env` files and exclude them from version control using `.gitignore`. Commit a `.env.example` file as a guide for developers, and set environment variables through standard means for production.

**References:**
- [Guide to managing environment variables in Node.js](https://medium.com/@rafaelvidaurre/managing-environment-variables-in-node-js-2cb45a55195f)

Q:: Why is it advised to validate environment variables before the app starts?

###### ID37

A:: Validating environment variables can prevent long troubleshooting sessions by catching errors early. Libraries like `joi` can be helpful for validating these values.

**References:**
- [Sample configuration with validation](./configWithTest.sample.js)

Q:: (Cloze) To specify the node version for a project, set it in the {{c1::engines}} field of {{c2::package.json}}.

###### ID38

A:: (Cloze) Specify the node version in the `engines` field of `package.json`. This clarifies the required node version for the project.

**References:**
- [npm documentation on engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines)

Q:: What is the purpose of using `nvm` and a `.nvmrc` file in a project?

###### ID39

A:: A `.nvmrc` file and `nvm` allow users to switch to the correct node version with `nvm use`, ensuring a consistent environment.

**References:**
- [nvm repository](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Q:: Why should a `preinstall` script be added to a project?

###### ID40

A:: A `preinstall` script that checks node and npm versions helps avoid dependency issues, which can arise if dependencies are installed with incompatible npm versions.

Q:: What are the benefits of using Docker in a project?

###### ID41

A:: Docker provides a consistent environment across development, testing, and production, minimizing dependency and configuration issues.

**References:**
- [Guide to Dockerizing a Node.js application](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-dockerize-a-node-js-application-4fbab45a0c19)

Q:: Why is it preferable to use local modules instead of globally installed ones?

###### ID42

A:: Local modules ensure that tooling is shared among team members, avoiding the need for each person to install global dependencies on their own systems.

Q:: (Cloze) To ensure consistent dependencies across a team, use {{c1::package-lock.json}} on {{c2::npm@5}} or higher, or alternatively use {{c3::Yarn}}.

###### ID43

A:: (Cloze) To maintain consistent dependencies, use `package-lock.json` with `npm@5` or higher, or alternatively use Yarn. This guarantees that all team members have the exact same dependencies, ensuring uniform code behavior across development environments.

**References:**
- [Guide to consistent dependencies across teams](https://kostasbariotis.com/consistent-dependencies-across-teams/)
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Q:: How can you ensure consistent dependencies when using older versions of npm?

###### ID44

A:: For older versions of npm, use `--save --save-exact` when installing a new dependency and create an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file before publishing. This will lock dependencies to specific versions, similar to `package-lock.json` in newer npm versions.

**References:**
- [npm documentation on package locks](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks)

#### Chapter 4 - Dependencies

![modules](../images/modules.png)

Q:: How can you list currently available npm packages in your project?

###### ID45

A:: You can use the command `npm ls --depth=0` to list currently available packages in your project.

**References:**
- [npm ls command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls)

Q:: What tool helps identify unused or irrelevant packages in a project?

###### ID46

A:: Use the `depcheck` tool to check for packages that have become unused or irrelevant in your project.

**References:**
- [Depcheck npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck)

Q:: Why is it important to remove unused dependencies?

###### ID47

A:: Removing unused dependencies helps reduce the production bundle size, which improves optimization and load times.

Q:: What should you evaluate before adding a new npm dependency?

###### ID48

A:: Before using a dependency, evaluate its release frequency, number of maintainers, and download statistics to determine if it is widely used and actively maintained. This helps ensure community support, ongoing updates, and timely bug fixes.

**References:**
- [npm view command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view)
- [npm-stat usage statistics](https://npm-stat.com/)

Q:: Why is maintainer activity crucial when selecting a dependency?

###### ID49

A:: Active maintainers are essential for quickly merging fixes and patches, ensuring your project can receive timely updates and improvements.

Q:: What should you do before using a lesser-known dependency?

###### ID50

A:: Discuss using any lesser-known dependencies with the team to ensure alignment and evaluate potential risks or alternatives.

Q:: (Cloze) To ensure your app works with the latest version of its dependencies without breaking, use the command {{c1::npm outdated}}.

###### ID51

A:: (Cloze) Use the command `npm outdated` to verify if any dependencies need updating, which can help keep your project current with the latest patches and features.

**References:**
- [npm outdated command documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to update dependencies one at a time?

###### ID52

A:: Updating dependencies one by one simplifies troubleshooting, making it easier to identify and resolve issues if something goes wrong.

Q:: What tool can simplify the process of updating npm packages?

###### ID53

A:: The [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) tool can help manage npm package updates more efficiently.

Q:: How can you check for security vulnerabilities in npm packages?

###### ID54

A:: Use tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test?utm_source=risingstack_blog) to scan for known security vulnerabilities in npm packages.

Q:: (Cloze) When updating dependencies, it's important to always check their {{c1::release notes}} when updates show up to be aware of potential {{c2::breaking changes}}.

###### ID55

A:: (Cloze) Always review dependency release notes to be aware of potential breaking changes. This helps you anticipate and handle compatibility issues that may arise from updates.

#### Chapter 5 - Testing

![testing](../images/testing.png)

Q:: Why is a separate `test` mode environment often necessary?

###### ID56

A:: A separate `test` mode environment can help avoid issues such as:

1. Preventing test data from affecting production analytics or dashboards.

2. Avoiding production API rate limits, which might block test calls if exceeded.

Q:: (Cloze) Test files should be placed {{c1::next to the tested modules}} using the naming convention {{c2::\*.test.js}} or {{c3::\*.spec.js}}.

###### ID57

A:: (Cloze) Place test files next to the modules they test, using the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`. This organization makes it easy to locate tests without navigating through complex folder structures.

**References:**
- [Read more on code structure for testability](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

Q:: Where should additional test files that don’t relate to specific files be stored?

###### ID58

A:: Store additional test files in a separate folder, usually named `__test__`, to keep them distinct from specific implementation files and reduce confusion.

Q:: Why is the `__test__` folder name widely adopted?

###### ID59

A:: The `__test__` folder name is considered a standard convention and is automatically recognized by many JavaScript testing frameworks.

Q:: What are the key characteristics of testable code?

###### ID60

A:: Testable code should:

1. Avoid side effects.
2. Extract side effects to isolated functions.
3. Make use of pure functions for predictable results.

Q:: (Cloze) A {{c1::pure function}} is a function that always returns the {{c2::same output}} for the {{c3::same input}}.

###### ID61

A:: (Cloze) A pure function always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects. In contrast, an impure function may rely on external factors or cause side effects, making it less predictable.

Q:: Why is test documentation important?

###### ID66

A:: Documenting tests provides clarity and context, making it easier for other developers, DevOps, QA, and future contributors to understand and run tests effectively.

#### Chapter 6 - Structure and Naming

![folder-tree](../images/folder-tree.png)

Q:: How should project files be organized?

###### ID67

A:: Organize files around product features, pages, or components, rather than by role. Place test files next to the code they test.

**Bad**

```
.
├── controllers
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
├── models
|   ├── product.js
|   └── user.js
```

**Good**

```
.
├── product
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── product.js
|   └── product.test.js
├── user
|   ├── index.js
|   ├── user.js
|   └── user.test.js
```

Q:: (Cloze) In a well-organized project structure, you should create {{c1::small modules}} that {{c2::encapsulate one responsibility}} including its {{c3::test}}.

###### ID68

A:: (Cloze) Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility, including their test. This structure makes it easier to navigate and find files quickly.

Q:: Where should additional test files be stored?

###### ID69

A:: Place additional test files in a separate test folder to avoid confusion.

Q:: Why is a dedicated test folder helpful for additional test files?

###### ID70

A:: A separate test folder saves time for other developers and DevOps experts by keeping test files organized and easy to locate.

Q:: (Cloze) Config files should be placed in a {{c1::./config}} folder, and you should {{c2::not make different config files}} for {{c3::different environments}}.

###### ID71

A:: (Cloze) Configuration files should go in a `./config` folder, without creating separate config files for each environment. Instead, manage configuration based on purpose (e.g., database, API) for a scalable approach.

Q:: How should values for configuration files be supplied?

###### ID72

A:: Use environment variables to provide values for config files, keeping configuration flexible and secure.

**References:**
- [Read more on configuration management](https://medium.com/@fedorHK/no-config-b3f1171eecd5)

Q:: Where should scripts be placed within the project structure?

###### ID73

A:: Place scripts, such as bash and node scripts, in a `./scripts` folder for organization and easy access.

Q:: Why is it useful to have a dedicated folder for scripts?

###### ID74

A:: A dedicated `./scripts` folder is helpful as projects often have multiple scripts, like production builds, development builds, database synchronization, and more.

Q:: (Cloze) Build output should be placed in a {{c1::./build}} folder, and {{c2::build/}} should be added to {{c3::.gitignore}}.

###### ID75

A:: (Cloze) Store build output in a `./build` folder and add `build/` to `.gitignore`. This folder contains generated files, which can be recreated as needed.

Q:: Why should build output not be committed to the remote repository?

###### ID76

A:: Generated files should be reproducible by any team member, so there’s no need to commit them to the remote repository unless specifically required.

#### Chapter 7 - Code Style

![code-style](../images/code-style.png)

Q:: What JavaScript syntax is recommended for new projects?

###### ID77

A:: Use stage-2 or higher (modern) JavaScript syntax for new projects. For older projects, remain consistent with the existing syntax unless you intend to modernize the project.

Q:: Why should stage-2 and higher JavaScript syntax be used?

###### ID78

A:: Stage-2 syntax is more stable and likely to become part of the official JavaScript specification, often with minor changes. Transpilers allow projects to leverage these features even before full browser support.

Q:: (Cloze) Code style checks should be included in your {{c1::build process}}.

###### ID79

A:: (Cloze) Code style checks should be part of your build process. Enforcing style checks in builds ensures consistency across client and server-side code. [Learn more](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)

Q:: What tool is recommended to enforce JavaScript code style?

###### ID80

A:: Use [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style in JavaScript projects.

Q:: Why is ESLint preferred for enforcing code style?

###### ID81

A:: ESLint offers extensive support for rules, customization options, and custom rule additions, making it highly flexible for enforcing code style.

Q:: Which JavaScript Style Guide is recommended?

###### ID82

A:: The [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is recommended for consistency and best practices.

**Additional Resources:**
- [More on Airbnb’s guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/duk/airbnb-javascript-guidelines/details)

Q:: (Cloze) For projects using {{c1::FlowType}}, it's recommended to use {{c2::Flow type style check rules}} for {{c3::ESLint}}.

###### ID83

A:: (Cloze) Use Flow type style check rules in ESLint for FlowType projects to ensure consistent style for Flow syntax.

**References:**
- [Flow type style check rules for ESLint](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype)
- [FlowType documentation](https://flow.org/)

Q:: What is the purpose of the `.eslintignore` file?

###### ID84

A:: Use the `.eslintignore` file to exclude specific files or folders from code style checks, avoiding the need for `eslint-disable` comments within the code.

Q:: What should be done with `eslint` disable comments before submitting a Pull Request?

###### ID85

A:: Remove all `eslint` disable comments before submitting a Pull Request to maintain code quality and style standards.

Q:: How should small tasks be marked in the code?

###### ID86

A:: Use `//TODO:` comments for small tasks. For larger tasks, use `//TODO(#3456)`, where the number corresponds to an open ticket for tracking.

Q:: (Cloze) Comments should be {{c1::kept relevant}} as code changes, and {{c2::commented blocks of code}} should be {{c3::removed}}.

###### ID87

A:: (Cloze) Comments should be kept relevant as code changes, and commented blocks of code should be removed. Code should be as readable as possible without distractions. If a function is refactored, remove the old code instead of commenting it out.

Q:: Why should irrelevant or humorous comments, logs, or names be avoided?

###### ID88

A:: Avoid irrelevant or humorous comments, logs, or naming. While these may be removed during the build process, source code might be handed to a different company or client, who may not appreciate this style.

Q:: What naming convention is recommended for functions?

###### ID89

A:: Use long, descriptive names for functions. A function name should be a verb or verb phrase that clearly communicates its intention and functionality.

Q:: How should functions be organized within a file?

###### ID90

A:: Organize functions in a file according to the step-down rule, placing higher-level functions at the top and lower-level functions below for readability and logical flow.

Q:: What is the purpose of a `.editorconfig` file?

###### ID91

A:: A [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs within a project. It defines coding styles and integrates well with version control systems, making it easy for developers to adhere to set conventions.

Q:: How can editors be set up to flag code style errors?

###### ID92

A:: Use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) with ESLint to integrate Prettier and receive notifications for code style issues within the editor. [Read more](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation).

Q:: Why consider using Git hooks in your workflow?

###### ID93

A:: Git hooks improve productivity by automating certain checks before code commits, reducing the chance of breaking builds in staging or production environments. [Learn more about Git hooks](http://githooks.com/).

Q:: What is the benefit of using Prettier with a precommit hook?

###### ID94

A:: Using Prettier with a precommit hook, along with `lint-staged` and `husky`, streamlines the process of code formatting. This setup saves time, as Prettier runs automatically before each commit, ensuring code consistency across the project. [More on `lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and [on `husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

#### Chapter 8 - Logging

![logging](../images/logging.png)

Q:: Why is it important to avoid client-side console logs in production?

###### ID95

A:: Avoid client-side console logs in production. While the build process should remove them, it's essential to have code style checks that flag any leftover console logs, preventing unintentional logging in production.

Q:: What is the recommended method for logging in production environments?

###### ID96

A:: Use logging libraries like [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for production logging. These tools enhance readability and manage logs more effectively than console logs.

Q:: What are the advantages of using logging libraries in production?

###### ID97

A:: Logging libraries improve the troubleshooting experience by offering features like colorization, timestamps, file-based logging alongside console logging, and even daily log rotation. [Read more on logging best practices](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/).

#### Chapter 9 - API

![api](../images/api.png)

Q:: What are the core components of resource-oriented design for APIs?

###### ID98

A:: The three main components in resource-oriented design are:

1. **Resources**: These have data, can be nested, and have methods that operate on them.
2. **Collections**: Groups of resources.
3. **URLs**: Identifiers for the online location of resources or collections.

Q:: How does resource-oriented design benefit API development?

###### ID99

A:: Resource-oriented design is beneficial for several reasons:

1. It is **well-known to developers**, the main consumers of APIs.
2. It enhances **readability and ease of use**.
3. It enables **generic libraries and connectors** without needing to know the specific API structure.

Q:: What naming case should be used for URLs and resource names in API design?

###### ID100

A:: Use **kebab-case** for URLs and **plural kebab-case** for resource names in URLs.

Q:: Which case is recommended for parameters in query strings or resource fields?

###### ID101

A:: Use **camelCase** for parameters in query strings or resource fields.

Q:: Why should collection URLs use plural nouns in API design?

###### ID102

A:: Collection URLs should use **plural nouns** (e.g., `/users`) to improve readability and maintain URL consistency.

References:
- [RESTful API Design: Plural Nouns and Concrete Names](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-plural-nouns-and-concrete-names)

Q:: How should plural nouns be handled in source code variables and properties?

###### ID103

A:: In the source code, convert plurals to variables and properties with a **List suffix**. Plural naming in URLs is clear, but it can be subtle and error-prone in code.

Q:: What is the best format for URLs that point to a specific resource?

###### ID104

A:: Use a singular resource that starts with a **collection** and ends with an **identifier**, like:

```
/students/245743
/airports/kjfk
```

Avoid formats like:

```
GET /blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId/summary
```

> This structure does not point to a resource but to a property. Instead, pass the property as a parameter to simplify responses.

Q:: (Cloze) In API design, it’s recommended to keep {{c1::verbs}} out of your {{c2::resource URLs}} because including verbs for each operation can lead to {{c3::a large number of URLs}} and {{c4::lack of a consistent pattern}}.

###### ID105

A:: (Cloze) Keeping verbs out of resource URLs helps **developers learn the API** more easily. In API design, verbs serve a different function.

Q:: When should verbs be used in API URLs?

###### ID106

A:: Use verbs for **non-resource URLs**, when the API does not return a resource but instead performs an operation, returning the result. These are not CRUD operations. For example:

```
/translate?text=Hallo
```

> CRUD operations use HTTP methods on resource or collection URLs. These verbs are typically **Controllers**, and only a few are usually necessary.

References:
- [API Guidelines: Controller](https://github.com/byrondover/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md#controller)

Q:: What is the recommended case for JSON property names in request bodies or response types?

###### ID107

A:: Use **camelCase** for JSON property names in request bodies and response types to maintain consistency, as these guidelines assume JavaScript will be used to generate and parse JSON.

Q:: Why avoid using table names and column names for resource names and properties in APIs?

###### ID108

A:: Avoid using `table_name` for resource names and `column_name` for resource properties because the API should expose **resources**, not the underlying **database schema**. This abstraction maintains separation between API design and database structure.

Q:: How should CRUD operations be represented with HTTP methods in API design?

###### ID109

A:: Represent CRUD operations using HTTP methods as follows:

- **GET**: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
- **POST**: Create new resources or sub-resources.
- **PUT**: Update existing resources.
- **PATCH**: Partially update existing resources, only for the fields supplied.
- **DELETE**: Delete existing resources.

Q:: What is the recommended way to structure URLs for nested resources?

###### ID110

A:: For nested resources, use URLs that represent the relationship between them. Examples:

- `GET /schools/2/students` retrieves the list of all students from school with ID 2.
- `GET /schools/2/students/31` retrieves details of student 31, who belongs to school 2.
- `DELETE /schools/2/students/31` deletes student 31 from school 2.
- `PUT /schools/2/students/31` updates information for student 31. Use `PUT` only on resource URLs, not collections.
- `POST /schools` creates a new school and returns details of the newly created school. Use `POST` on collection URLs.

Q:: How should API versioning be handled in URLs?

###### ID111

A:: Use a **simple ordinal number with a "v" prefix** (e.g., `v1`, `v2`) for versioning, and place it at the beginning of the URL to give it the **highest scope**. For example:

```
http://api.domain.com/v1/schools/3/students
```

> When APIs are public, versioning helps manage changes that may affect third-party services, allowing updates without breaking existing implementations.

References:
- [RESTful API Design Tips: Versioning](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-tips-versioning)

Q:: (Cloze) An effective error message response in an API should include a {{c1::code}}, a {{c2::message}}, and a {{c3::description}}. For validation errors, it should also include an {{c4::errors}} array with detailed information on each error.

###### ID112

A:: (Cloze) Providing structured error responses helps developers troubleshoot issues. 

An example error message might look like:

```json
{
  "code": 1234,
  "message": "Something bad happened",
  "description": "More details"
}
```

Or for validation errors:

```json
{
  "code": 2314,
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1233,
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Invalid email"
    },
    {
      "code": 1234,
      "field": "password",
      "message": "No password provided"
    }
  ]
}
```

Q:: What are key HTTP status codes to use in API responses, and what do they indicate?

###### ID113

A:: Important HTTP status codes include:

- **200 OK**: Success for `GET`, `PUT`, or `POST` requests.
- **201 Created**: Indicates a new resource was successfully created (used with `POST`).
- **204 No Content**: Success with no content to send in the response (common for successful `DELETE`).
- **304 Not Modified**: Used to reduce data transfer when the recipient has a cached version.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be processed due to client error.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Request lacks valid credentials; should prompt re-authentication.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses authorization.
- **404 Not Found**: Indicates the requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A valid request could not be fulfilled due to server issues.

Q:: How can data returned in an API response be limited?

###### ID114

A:: Use a **fields query parameter** to specify a comma-separated list of fields to include. For example:

```
GET /students?fields=id,name,age,class
```

Q:: (Cloze) In API design, it’s recommended to provide {{c1::total numbers of resources}} in your response and to accept {{c2::limit}} and {{c3::offset}} parameters for {{c4::pagination}}.

###### ID115

A:: (Cloze) For resources that support filtering and sorting, document these capabilities, although they need not be available for all resources at the start.

Q:: Why is it important to use familiar HTTP status codes in API responses?

###### ID116

A:: Using **common HTTP status codes** is essential because most developers do not memorize all 70+ HTTP status codes. Relying on common codes helps prevent developers from needing to look up meanings, thus keeping their workflow efficient. Most API providers use a **limited subset of codes** for consistency and ease of use.

References:
- [Using Standard HTTP Status Codes](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-what-about-errors)

Q:: How should security exception messages be handled in API responses?

###### ID117

A:: Keep **security exception messages generic** to avoid unintentionally revealing information. For example, instead of replying with "incorrect password," use a message like "invalid username or password" to prevent disclosing that the username was correct.

Q:: Why avoid using basic authentication without HTTPS?

###### ID118

A:: Basic authentication should be avoided over unsecured connections because it sends the **user ID and password in clear text** (encoded in base64, which is reversible). Without HTTPS, this information can be easily intercepted, compromising security.

References:
- [Basic Authentication and HTTPS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)

Q:: How should authentication tokens be handled in API requests?

###### ID119

A:: **Authentication tokens** should be included in every request using the `Authorization` header, like so: `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx, Extra yyyyy`. **Avoid sending tokens in the URL** for security reasons.

Q:: (Cloze) To enhance API security, {{c1::Authorization Code}} should be {{c2::short-lived}}, and any {{c3::non-TLS requests}} should be rejected by responding with {{c4::403 Forbidden}}.

###### ID120

A:: (Cloze) These security practices help prevent **unauthorized access** and safeguard **data integrity** over secure connections.

Q:: Why is Rate Limiting important for API security?

###### ID121

A:: **Rate Limiting** is crucial to protect your API from bot threats that may attempt thousands of calls per hour. It’s best to implement rate limiting **early in API development** to prevent abuse and protect resources.

Q:: What should an API do to handle received data securely?

###### ID122

A:: An API should **convert received data to its canonical form** or reject it if it does not meet requirements. When errors arise due to bad or missing data, the API should respond with a **400 Bad Request** and provide error details.

Q:: Why is JSON serialization important in API responses?

###### ID123

A:: **JSON serialization** is essential to prevent JavaScript **remote code execution** in the browser or on the server (if using Node.js). A proper JSON serializer ensures **user-supplied data** is encoded correctly, blocking any execution of such input on the client side.

Q:: (Cloze) When validating the content-type in API requests, it’s recommended to primarily accept {{c1::application/\*json}}. Accepting other MIME types like {{c2::application/x-www-form-urlencoded}} could allow attackers to {{c3::create a form and trigger a simple POST request}}.

###### ID124

A:: (Cloze) The server should **never assume the Content-Type**. If the Content-Type header is missing or does not meet expectations, the server should respond with a **4XX error** to reject the content.

Q:: What security enhancements can HTTP headers provide for APIs?

###### ID125

A:: Setting **HTTP headers** properly can help secure your API by controlling what information is shared. The Helmet project offers a set of middleware for Express applications to set headers that enhance security.

References:
- [Helmet for HTTP Header Security](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

Q:: How should data validation be handled in APIs?

###### ID126

A:: The API should validate **all data exchanged**—both incoming requests and outgoing responses—to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and security across the API.

Q:: Where can you find a comprehensive API security checklist?

###### ID127

A:: The **API Security Checklist Project** offers a detailed list of best practices to secure APIs effectively.

References:
- [API Security Checklist Project on GitHub](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist)

Q:: What should be included in the API Reference section of the README.md file?

###### ID128

A:: The **API Reference section** in the README.md should include a complete overview of the API, detailing authentication methods, URL structure, request types, and endpoint information.

References:
- [README.md Template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md)

Q:: How should API authentication methods be documented?

###### ID129

A:: **API authentication methods** should be documented with a **code sample** to clearly show proper usage.

Q:: What information should be provided to explain the URL structure of an API?

###### ID130

A:: When explaining the **URL structure** of an API, include the **path** (excluding the root URL) and **HTTP request method** for each endpoint.

Q:: How should URL parameters be documented in API documentation?

###### ID131

A:: Document URL parameters by:

- **Specifying** if they are required or optional
- **Naming** each parameter and providing its data type

For example:

```
Required: id=[integer]
Optional: photo_id=[alphanumeric]
```

Q:: (Cloze) For POST requests in API documentation, you should provide {{c1::working examples}} and separate the parameters into {{c2::Optional}} and {{c3::Required}} sections.

###### ID132

A:: (Cloze) This format helps users understand how to correctly structure their **POST requests**.

Q:: What details should be included in the Success Response section of API documentation?

###### ID133

A:: The **Success Response** section should include:

- The **expected status code**
- Any **return data**

For example:

```
Code: 200
Content: { id : 12 }
```

Q:: How should Error Responses be documented in API documentation?

###### ID134

A:: Document **Error Responses** by including:

- All possible failure scenarios for an endpoint (e.g., unauthorized access, incorrect parameters)
- **Error code, message, and description** for each error case

For example:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Authentication failed",
  "description": "Invalid username or password"
}
```

Q:: Why is it important to document all potential error responses for an API endpoint?

###### ID135

A:: Documenting all possible error responses helps **avoid assumptions** by API users. Even if it seems repetitive, it sets **clear expectations** for potential failures.

Q:: (Cloze) Two popular open-source tools for API documentation are {{c1::API Blueprint}} and {{c2::Swagger}}.

###### ID136

A:: (Cloze) These tools support standardized, clear API documentation.

References:
- [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

Q:: What are the key components to document for each API endpoint?

###### ID137

A:: For each API endpoint, include the following in the documentation:

1. **URL structure** (path only, no root URL)
2. **Request type** (Method)
3. **URL parameters** (specify if required or optional)
4. **Request body** for POST requests, with examples
5. **Success response** (status code and return data)
6. **Error responses** (status codes, messages, and descriptions)

#### Chapter 10 - Accessibility

[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/)

![accessibility](../images/accessibility.png)

Q:: Why is it important to consider accessibility at the start of a web project?

###### ID138

A:: Web content is [accessible by default](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML), but we often compromise this when building complex features. It's much easier to maintain accessibility by considering it from the start rather than re-implementing features later.

Q:: What tools are recommended for regular accessibility audits?

###### ID139

A:: Two recommended tools for regular accessibility audits are:

1. [Lighthouse accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) in Google Chrome DevTools

2. The [axe DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US)

Q:: (Cloze) The scoring in accessibility audit tools like Lighthouse and axe is based on {{c1::axe user impact assessments}}.

###### ID140

A:: (Cloze) These assessments help determine the severity and impact of accessibility issues.

[axe user impact assessments](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md#wcag-21-level-a--aa-rules)

Q:: What important accessibility checks must be done manually?

###### ID141

A:: Some important accessibility checks that must be done manually include logical tab order. These are often listed as manual/guided tests alongside automated results in tools like Lighthouse and axe.

[Read more...](https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/#additional-items-to-manually-check)

Q:: What are some recommended accessibility linters for different frameworks?

###### ID142

A:: Recommended accessibility linters for different frameworks include:

- React: [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

- Angular: [Angular Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer)

- Vue: [eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility](https://github.com/vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to use an accessibility linter in a project?

###### ID143

A:: An accessibility linter automatically checks that a basic level of accessibility is met by your project and is relatively easy to set up.

Q:: (Cloze) For accessibility testing, it's recommended to set up and use {{c1::[axe-core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n5Ul7WPc3Y&list=PLMlWGnpsViOMt24a-Y_dybv68H-kj6Un6&t=1649s)}} or similar tools. If using Storybook, you can implement {{c2::[accessibility testing with Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/blog/accessibility-testing-with-storybook/)}}.

###### ID144

A:: (Cloze) Including accessibility checks in your tests helps catch any changes that affect your project's accessibility and audit score.

Q:: What are some examples of accessible design systems?

###### ID145

A:: Two examples of accessible design systems are:

1. [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/)

2. [Material Design](https://material.io/design)

Q:: Why is it beneficial to use an accessible design system?

###### ID146

A:: Accessible design systems provide components that are highly accessible out of the box, making it easier to maintain accessibility throughout your project.

Q:: What should be considered when agreeing on a minimum accessibility score for a project?

###### ID147

A:: When agreeing on a minimum accessibility score, consider your project's specific requirements. The score should be based on the results from tools like Lighthouse or axe, which use axe user impact assessments to determine the severity of accessibility issues.

Q:: Why is it important to ensure link names are accessible?

###### ID148

A:: Inaccessible link elements pose barriers to accessibility. Using aria-label to describe links can help make them more accessible to users relying on assistive technologies.

Q:: How should lists be structured for accessibility?

###### ID149

A:: Lists must have both parent and child elements to be valid. This is important because screen readers inform users when they come to a list and how many items are in the list.

Q:: Why is the correct semantic structure of headings important for accessibility?

###### ID150

A:: Headers convey the structure of the page. When applied correctly, the page becomes easier to navigate, especially for users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

Q:: (Cloze) Ensuring text elements have {{c1::sufficient contrast}} against the page background is important because some people with {{c2::low vision}} experience {{c3::low contrast}}, making it difficult to distinguish {{c4::outlines, borders, edges, and details}}.

###### ID151

A:: (Cloze) Text that is too close in luminance (brightness) to the background can be hard to read for these users.

Q:: Why is it necessary to provide alternative text for images?

###### ID152

A:: Screen readers have no way of translating an image into words that get read to the user, even if the image only consists of text. Therefore, it's necessary for images to have short, descriptive alt text so screen reader users can clearly understand the image's contents and purpose.

Q:: Where can more accessibility rules be found?

###### ID153

A:: More accessibility rules can be found at [Deque University's axe rules](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe).

#### Chapter 11 - Licensing

![licensing](../images/licensing.png)

Q:: (Cloze) When using resources in your project, it's important to ensure you have the {{c1::rights to use}} them. For libraries, look for licenses such as {{c2::MIT}}, {{c3::Apache}}, or {{c4::BSD}}.

###### ID154

A:: (Cloze) However, if you modify these libraries, you should review the license details carefully.

Q:: What potential legal issues should be considered when using images and videos in a project?

###### ID155

A:: Copyrighted images and videos may cause legal problems. It's important to ensure you have the right to use any visual content in your project.
